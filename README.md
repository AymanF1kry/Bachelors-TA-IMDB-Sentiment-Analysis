> A **text analysis project** focused on understanding viewer sentiment from IMDB reviews of the movie *Madam Web*. This project was developed under the **Text Analysis** subject during my bachelor‚Äôs degree. It demonstrates the full end-to-end pipeline of a sentiment analysis workflow‚Äîfrom data gathering to model evaluation and visual storytelling.

## üß∞ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Jupyter Notebook** (main environment)
- **TextBlob** for sentiment scoring  
- **Lexicon-based approach**  
- **Machine Learning classifiers**: Naive Bayes and SVM  
- **Confusion Matrices** for model evaluation  
- **WordCloud & Seaborn** for visualization

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Sentiment_Analysis_Script`) to walk through the entire project workflow.
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (e.g., `textblob`, `sklearn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud`).
3. Load the IMDB review dataset (`mw_user_reviews.csv`) into the notebook when prompted.
4. Follow through the code sections: preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
5. For a detailed narrative of the analysis, findings, and conclusions, refer to the `Findings_Report` (PDF).
