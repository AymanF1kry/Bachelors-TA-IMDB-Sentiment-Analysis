eoinageary,3,Yikes,"This is, well I guess this is a movie in the Sony universe that I'm SHOCKED is profitable.The story is all over the place, it's basically about Madame Web who is a paramedic and develops powers and can see into the future, with a current threat she tries to change the future, teaming up with 3 powerful characters who are yet to develop into their full potential so she must shield them and change the future to protect them.Trying not to give the little story that gets told away in the opening there but i have to be vague.What I liked, one or two good scenes, I didn't mind the end, I really liked a lot of the camera work some cool looking shots and a decent Score.But the movie is BAD, it makes Morbius look like The Batman 2022. The acting is lacking, the actors look as bored as you will feel. Script is bad, just some beyond silly lines, the story chops and changes so much your neck will hurt you, some bad CGI, and just boring action.And before people harp on about ""you don't like it because it's women leads"" no, it's just a crap film, I enjoyed the marvels, Black Widow was decent, so no, the movie regardless of its leads is just poor.Extremely disappointing, 3/10."
sinscopefilms,3,I regret watching this film,"First Impression:The opening of the Madame Web was immersed in a mystique and ambition, enhanced by great musical score; yet, as the movie progresses, it becomes a mixed bag and a rollercoaster of emotions.The Positive:Musical Score and Sound Design: The standout feature of ""Madame Web"" is its musical score. The soundtrack not only enhances the emotional depth of the film but also succeeds in creating in some moments genuine goosebumps. The sound design really enhances this impact by carefully using sound pans, bass, and reverse effects. It creates a sense of tension and immersion which is one of the film's strongest features.The Mixed:Visual Effects and Costume Design: Some of the visual effects in ""Madame Web"" were visually appealing. The costume design, like Casey's red jacket and the three spider girl villain outfits standing out as particularly stunning contributions to the film's aesthetic, but it was not often shown in the film since the films direction and focus was different. I was disappointed.Acting and Direction: Although I thought Casey's character development - her ability to see the world from a different perspective - was great, I didn't like how it was visually presented. The way it was edited was poorly done. The editor could use 2 distinct color grading features where one sees the future and two, she sees the present moment.However, The performances throughout the film feel lackluster, with the actors appearing confused and disengaged. This, combined with direction that fails to maintain interest or coherence in many scenes, significantly undermines the film's potential.Negatives:Cinematography: Cinematography is bad since some pictures don't show a clear image. The camera moves so fast that I cannot comprehend the picture. I kind of recognized that it tries to initiate the rapidness of the events from the spider's eye point of view but it was a tasteless decision. The Cinematography is not something like wow. The reason why Cinematography was lacking is because it was heavily based on medium closeups and dutch tilts which on one hand was a unique choice but on the other hand very hard to watch. I found the 180 degree round camera rotations super cool, but again, I expected varied distance shots, not just medium shots. The train scene Cinematography was the best in the film.Editing and Pace: The editing is arguably the weakest element of ""Madame Web,"" with its rapid cuts and disjointed flow detracting significantly from the storytelling. This lack of coherence makes it challenging for the audience to fully engage with the narrative.Plot and Overall Execution: The storyline of ""Madame Web"" is cluttered and clichéd, suffering from a lack of originality and clear direction. The film's ambition is evident, but the execution falls short of creating a compelling narrative.The Conclusion:""Madame Web"" presents a paradoxical experience, with exceptional music and sound design standing that sharply contrasts with its various flaws in editing, cinematography, and direction.Although there are some visually and emotionally stunning moments, they are frequently overshadowed by a lack of coherence and clarity.Also, I think this film would be reasonable and great to be incorporated in a TV series which would have allowed for a more in-depth exploration of characters and plot.Nevertheless, Madame Web is a bit of a mixed bag, with moments of potential that ultimately leave the viewer something different visually.Rating: 3/10."
syntory,2,How are bad writers able to continually get hired for big budget films?,"Look at the profiles for the writers that wrote Madame Web. You'll see virtually every movie they've written has a bad rating and bad reviews. Why then does Hollywood continually hire these same writers for these big budget films? I could understand if they wrote movies for Asylum Films because all their movies are terrible.Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!"
MovieWarfare,1,Makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight,"I would absolutely love to be in these Sony meetings because I am absolutely baffled how things like Madame Web are getting greenlit.Madame Web is one of the worst superhero movies ever made! It has terrible writing, characters, action setpieces and even acting. Dakota Johnson is so dull and boring as the main lead but this is probably down to the terrible script.To be fair, the movie does have an interesting concept with this Final Destination x Terminator thing. However, it is so poorly executed that it makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight.Anyway give me the ""He Was in the Amazon With My Mom When She Was Researching Spiders Right Before She Died"" cut!"
johnnychicago-75285,6,Not as bad as most people claim...,"I don't understand what the big problem is. Yes, the movie may not be the best superhero movie, but the low ratings aren't justified either. Overall, the story is sometimes told in a rushed manner and the script doesn't deserve an Oscar, but overall the movie was entertaining. To be honest, I was expecting the worst and I was biased because of the negative ratings. After watching the movie, I couldn't understand all the hate for the movie at all. I'm already reasonably discerning when it comes to movies, but guys, let's be honest, this isn't an art house movie, this is popcorn cinema. The movie is supposed to entertain and it did. Even if it was a bit bumpy in places. Overall, I can recommend the movie to people who just want to be entertained. Not more and not less."
chenp-54708,1,A gigantic mess,"Literally one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen.From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on. It's unfortunate cause female superhero leads are something I love to see more like Wonder Woman and The Old Guard which are pretty fun. But unfortunately, it seemed that it likely isn't going to happen anytime soon.There really isn't anything else to say.Bad."
ddolcevitax,8,Watched it because of all the bad reviews ... glad I did!,"You really can't please an audience nowadays. People keep dragging it for no reason. I watched it because of the bad reviews and honestly, I'm glad I did. Enjoyed it and wouldn't mind seeing it at the movies.It was quite refreshing seeing Dakota in a superhero movie, I think she did a great job.Usually I like all the movied that most people dislike so I'm not really surprised.Just enjoy it, some movies are made to entertain you for those two hours without being deep and making you question your existence.So I don't really see why all the bad reviews. Like I said, impossible to please people nowadays ..."
angulolawoffice,6,It wasn't that bad,"Hobbs & shaw, 3 of fast and furious movies, the last jedi and morbius are just a few movies that I can name that are worse than this movie. The plot is straight forward, with weaknesses, and the acting is adequate. It's not a great movie by any means, but it made sense and was entertaining.Dakota Johnson is not a good actress in any movie, so she's always miscast. I can think of many actresses that could have played her role. She was a little distracting, as she always is. Had a better actress been hired, it would have made the movie better.The three ""teens"" were not given enough lines, but they all acted as ""typical teens"".I do wish more background on Ezekiel were given. He was definitely fascinating character. This was the biggest weakness of the film.I'm going to watch again.But from a critical analysis of the film, it's terrible. Just like 90% of commercial films."
AlsExGal,2,"I had a bad feeling about this one, going in...","... when I saw Dakota Johnson was starring in it. Naturally I can't lay the entirety of this hot mess at her feet. But there is some really bad campy acting happening on her part, reminiscent of the Fifty Shades of Grey movies in which she starred. Perhaps it was because the director was more interested in the placement of Pepsi cans than her performance, but I digress.Basically, this movie plays out like the cut scenes from a budget Xbox 360 game. From the ground up this thing just feels designed to fail. It feels almost Producersesque in its approach in just how every aspect is seemingly intentionally mangled, yet no one seems to care. How have we come so full circle to go through the glory of Infinity War/Logan/The Dark Knight to arrive all the way back to Batman and Robin and Catwoman levels of superhero flicks? (Bam!, Pow!, Gosh yes Batman!)How did this movie make it so far that it has an actual release, and no one stopped it? How did this idea get green lit? Why did Sony give 80 million and turn over their valuable IP to the people that wrote Morbius, Gods of Egypt, Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter? How did this get past the writing process and again have that script greenlit? How could no one on the set at any point stop things? How did no one in the editing room point out how bad it looked and how much of a mess it was?But to the suits it's not about art and story. Instead it's about business, and people are just a commodity. It's cheaper to recycle known quantities, and practice nepotism and involve maybe less than talented friends, people you've worked with before, than go out and find artists with worthy stories. They don't care about art, they don't care about stories, they care about making this work for them financially, regardless of loss of reputation with audiences as a whole.Youtuber Chris Stuckmann did a deep dive on the topic of big studios being generally run by folks who came up through management rather than the creative rungs such as writing and directing when he discussed this film. His take is worth watching. For some reason, Chris doesn't do critical movie reviews since he has become a filmmaker, but I can tell by his tone that, like me, he was completely displeased watching this one. I'd avoid it."
hotrobinproductions,1,Movie featuring Pepsi & product placement,"Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse. There is quite noticeable audio dub edited after the fact too. This budget is 80 million, not that budget matters, because no amount of money could have saved this train wreck, but I mention this because you can still make a good film on lower budgets, Shazam, the first one, had the same budget & delt with a lot of side characters too, it's miles better, Godzilla minus one had a extremely low budget too. But this 80 million dollar film not just effects but production, feels obviously cheap, it almost feels like watching a very long pilot episode to a CW tv show.You thought Morbius was bad, that film was bad because it did the bare minimum, this film doesn't even do the bare minimum, it goes beyond comprehension below that, it just enters a point of no originality or ambition towards creating anything. There isn't even a single superhero moment, even horrible films like catwoman or Morbius has superhero moments & action, this thing doesn't, you get instead visions of the future to potentially set up sequels.This movie also has a serious problem of product placement, it's a long commercial, to be exact a long Pepsi commercial, I feel like Pepsi stopped the halftime show so they could invest in the product placement in this film. This movie was more important to them than the superbowl LOL it's just so over the top & obviously placed way too much in this film. Calvin Klein, Chase bank, the list goes on. This movie should be called superhero product placement the movie.It's barely even close to a 1/10 the cool moments are seeing what we already saw in the trailer when she's seeing the future & you think it's happening now but then it goes back to the moment she realizes it's a vision, granted it's cool the first couple times but it gets old REAL quick. & it ends up getting annoying because it's abused way too much.Thats about it, there isn't any redeeming things in this film, the acting isn't even good. I would say the 3 side character spider women that Dakota finds when they are together there was a potential spark. I saw the talent & potential, but they are failed big time by such a horrid script that the spark never even sparks, it's just like showing you the matches & gasoline & not setting the fire.Madame M0RBIUS / 10."
ethanbresnett,3,A massive waste of time,"Based on Madame Web's woeful reviews I was expecting this film to be an utter car crash. To its credit I will say it isn't entirely without merit, but it is incredibly boring and bland.Mostly this is because nothing particularly happens. It's a superhero movie with little to no superhero action and a painfully long set up for an underwhelming final act. The characters are so underdeveloped that there is no emotional connection or investment in any of them. Everything about the story and writing just feels lazy, vacuous and corny.Then there's the villain who is utterly uninspiring. He is constantly complaining about 'everything he has built' being destroyed. What has he built you might ask? The film has no interest in exploring this question. He's easily one of the more two dimensional and weak superhero villains I've ever seen committed to screen.Perhaps the most heinous crime this movie commits is to waste the talents of Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Zosia Mamet and more. Such a good cast was assembled and they were given absolutely nothing to work with, so I don't blame the performers. It's just such a shame to see such great talent put to the sword like this.As if all of this wasn't enough, the movie also feels remarkably low budget and feels excruciatingly long despite its relatively short runtime.Ultimately I think this film suffered because it was clearly intended as a set up for a wider Spider-Woman franchise which is unlikely to come to fruition. There seemed to be no interest in making a good stand alone movie, and no respect for the audience. A massive waste of time."
olcare,1,"I am filled with hatred, it can't get any worse.","It's the worst movie and superhero adaptation I've watched in recent years. Completely atrocious effects, atrocious screenplay, and atrocious acting. Also, a big insult to all comic book readers and those who know the original story.Let me describe the movie simply. First of all, I am filled with hatred; I really want to curse the entire creative team for this unacceptable film.All the performances are bad, everyone. There's not a single good actor trying; everyone just took the role for money. It's a terrible disgrace, a total eclipse of reason.The screenplay is the worst superhero screenplay I've ever seen. It barely resembles the original story, and if there aren't scenes like the other Spider-Girls in the trailer, why include them? There's no such obligation; instead, write a decent screenplay. All action scenes are full of logical errors; they've written it without thinking, it's complete garbage.Apart from these, the direction, sorry to say, is garbage too. Most scenes are shot as if they were taken straight from a phone camera; action scenes are not shown, they're hidden due to the atrociousness of the effects. It's shameful.After these general points, Sony urgently needs to cancel this universe; the original stories are garbage, there's no logic, no connection anywhere. They're just being shot randomly. I don't like to curse, but I hope this film sinks at the box office.The last scene with Madame Web gaining her powers, those web effects, clinging to souls, it's unbelievable how you approved this film, may God punish you.I don't know which one to talk about; all the atrocities are collected in this film. Whether it's the woman going to Peru and back in 30 seconds, Spider-Man dodging with fireworks, dancing at the boys' table when my daughters are left alone, not telling the story of the Spider-Human community, or the woman talking normally while giving birth at the end, everything is a disgrace. I hope this universe sinks, and you all get fired. No one involved in the management of this film deserves their job respectfully; they should quit immediately.Note: Dakota Johnson made a statement saying she didn't watch the movie. Why are you serving a completely garbage film if you're not going to watch it? Life shouldn't be all about money for you; we, in our poverty, are trying to watch it, and this is no different from cursing all the audience's families. Shame on you.Note 2: Just now, I looked at the budget of the movie, and my anger grew even more, 80 million dollars EIGHTY MILLION. How can I not believe this money, I really can't believe it, it's nothing but disrespect to yourself, disrespect to the audience, nothing but an insult."
Skruffbagg,1,"So bad it's good, or so bad it's bad? You decide","Cannon, is that you in disguise?I firmly believe Madame Web will go down in history as not only the worst superhero movie, but also one of the worst movies ever made. It's that bad. It's absolutely fascinating to behold.Now, I'll be honest with you here. I only went to see this because I had heard it was an unmitigated disaster that had to be seen to be believed, and it truly does not disappoint - or massively does, depending on your viewpoint.It takes a special kind of director to get such cringe-inducing performances out of a fairly talented cast (Dakota Johnson and Tahar Rahim are both quality actors with the right script and direction), but SJ Clarkson somehow manages to wrangle the absolute worst imaginable from every single person in the film. I'll be very surprised if she ever does another feature after this.Nothing in this film works; the plot is moronic, the script seems like it was written by a teenager, the cinematography is horrendous, the aformentioned embarrassing performances, the audio editing is baffling (so much dubbing, brain-melting music choices). I'm amazed this didn't get shelved the minute the final cut was done.To me, I rate this as ""so bad it's good"" as I wasn't bored watching it, but most people I assume will say it's just plain bad... and it is, but very entertainingly so.If you love watching a 2hr car crash then I highly recommend this. The awfulness is mind-boggling in it's complexity, but in the best possible way. Film scholars and historians will be analysing this movie for years to come, and I hope it is talked about in the same vein as The Room in the future.An absolutely epic misfire on all levels."
omed69,7,Is it always bad if it's not part of the MCU?,"""Madame Web"" offers a refreshing departure from the typical MCU formula, inviting audiences to immerse themselves in the world of one of Marvel's lesser-known heroes. Detaching oneself from the expectation of a seamless integration into the broader MCU narrative allows for a more enjoyable viewing experience. While it may not reach the heights of some of its counterparts, the film still manages to deliver an entertaining ride, filled with enough thrills and excitement to keep audiences engaged. At its core, cinema is about escapism, and ""Madame Web"" certainly accomplishes that goal, providing viewers with a welcome respite from reality for its runtime. Criticisms of the film seem misplaced when compared to the mindless entertainment found in other media forms like reality TV. In the end, ""Madame Web"" deserves credit for its efforts to bring a lesser-known character to the forefront and provide audiences with a dose of enjoyable escapism. So, before casting judgment, perhaps it's worth considering the simple pleasure of having fun at the movies, regardless of whether it meets every critic's lofty expectations. So chill out haters. Press pause on love island and get off your high horses."
vfphvnpp,2,"Badly made, weird film","I understand what the plan was here. They wanted a trippy film, focusing on a strong future for the Sony verse. The problem is the delivery. The camera work in this movie made it quite irritating to follow, as there was constant quick close up shots of the action. The dialogue was awful, and there was quite a lot of blatant voice over during the villain scenes.So much wasted time was given to boring scenes in the movie, which led me to believe the screen writers finished the script and realised that it was under the word count.Honestly the acting quality was quite poor across the board, especially the villain, who honestly seems as if they didn't cast for his role at all, just picked up someone off the side of the road.For someone who's guilty pleasure is watching bad movies, I it was a painful time. Don't recommend."
fung0,8,"In what crazy universe is this ""the worst movie of all time""??","There's some sort of madness that sweeps over movie critics and movie fans every so often. Some pundit, reviewer, influencer or other nitwit sounds off about how feeble, terrible, horribly BAD a movie is (or is *going* to be - these opinions often predate any viewing of the actual movie). And then the herd instinct takes over and generates a tsunami of contempt.Case in point, Madame Web - a truly ridiculous number of one-star reviews, completely unjustified by the actual experience of watching the movie.The surprising truth is that this is actually quite a decent little movie. It's no work of genius, but it is a workmanlike, efficient, competent piece of entertainment. Not only is it not ""the worst,"" it is far more entertaining than a whole host of bloated, forgettable superhero flicks of the past few years.Start with the characters. We have an interesting heroine, Cassandra Webb, nicely embodied by Dakota Johnson. She's likeable, believable and suitably challenged by events she doesn't really understand. I can't speak to Johnson's acting range, not having seen her in anything else, but she seems to fit this particular part perfectly.Most of the movie has to do with Cassandra's attempts to protect three teen-age girls. All three of them are presented as distinct personalities, and are elevated beyond mere stereotypes by earnest and appealing performances by the trio of actresses. I not only believed them, I was happy to spend time with them.Then there's the story. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it's done well. The origin of Cassandra's odd powers is novel, and revealed in stages that keep us guessing. Refreshingly, Cassandra needs to hold a super-villain at bay without actually knowing there's such a thing as a super-hero movie - or that she's in one.Better yet, Cassandra's super-talent is inherently unpredictable, in an interesting way. It reminded me of the excellent Nicolas Cage film Next, in which he has the ability to see the future - two minutes at a time. The storyline of Madame Web is somewhat formulaic, to be sure - but it's a good formula, and well-executed. I never felt my intelligence was being insulted, and I certainly never felt bored.The inevitable computer effects are used sparingly. Action is kept on a human scale - far more engrossing than watching CG heroes destroying planets with their pinky fingers.I tip-toed into Madame Web with dire forebodings of a wasted evening. Two hours later I found myself wishing the movie was longer - and wondering what ghastly childhood traumas must have prompted the vast torrents of vitriol that have been aimed at it.Sure, Madame Web isn't a breakthrough of any kind. But it's a completely professional piece of work - a solid two hours' escape from the troubles of the real world. Maybe it doesn't follow the comics - I don't know, and couldn't possibly care less. Maybe there were some nasty studio conflicts during production - again, not my concern. The end result was good. I had fun. Unless you come in solidly determined to hate, I can't see why you wouldn't have fun too.Rating: 8 out of 10. To me, 7 indicates a movie that succeeds in its aims - that entertains and does nothing conspicuously off-putting, worth seeing for anyone who likes the genre. However, I felt compelled to add an extra mercy star to offset the numerous undeservedly low ratings."
Schmendrick,7,Doesn't deserve the hate,"I honestly don't know why so much hate was directed at this movie. It may not be as great as Iron Man or Captain America, but it was more enjoyable than the painfully unoriginal Morbius. Here, Dakota Johnson gives a credible performance as the main character. The teens were OK, not nearly as annoying as people make them out to be, considering that they were troubled teens (if they weren't, they'd be dead), who didn't know the main character for half a day. I did find the antagonist's performance pretty stilted. The story basically plays like a slasher/Terminator flick where the antagonist is a ""Spider-Man"" instead of a robot. I personally found the idea interesting, and the movie did a pretty good job fleshing it out. Though there is the possibility of a sequel/crossover, I guess the studio isn't hopeful, as there was no post-credits scene. It would've been interesting seeing her reactions meeting up with the MCU Spider-Man, but I won't get my hopes up."
MiroslavKyuranov,4,Fifty Shades Of Mess,"It's astonishing to think that Sony could put out a worse product than 2022's Morbius, but boy, ""Madame Web"" manages it. It is an embarrassing mess. Talented stars wasted on probably one of the worst comic book movie ever (which nobody asked for). Filled with atrocious dialogue, awkward editing and laughable structure. It's a clunky, poorly-written, messy, and sloppy movie packed with some mediocre editing and performances.The concept is interesting on paper, but it couldn't be saved due to it's terrible execution. ""Madame Web"" simply lacked the spark it needed in nearly every dept.There is simply nothing memorable in this movie, except maybe some superhero costumes, but that doesn't redeem the fact that the movie is bad.So yeah...""Madame Web"" is yet another disappointing entry in the Sony's Spider-Less universe. It's like a love letter to an era of superhero films that people largely want to forget. The ""Pepsi"" adds are stand-out, it falls short of what could have been a decent movie in the hands of someone else twenty years ago."
ItsAustinHarris,5,Exceeded my low expectations.,"I went in with very low expectations and I felt like I got better than I was expecting and had a nice time watching the film. Despite having a budget of 80 million dollars, the movie feels low budget. Was not to the level of a modern marvel film but more like a marvel tv show.The characters were not as well established or as likable as they could of been. It was cluttered and cliche and suffers form a lack of originality. The cast deserved better, wasted talents of Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney. The villain was generic and uninspiring. Constantly complaining about ""everything he as built' being destroyed, while not showing anything that he has built.Im not fully up on the real origin story but after looking into it more it seems Sony fully molested the comic book version for their own that barely resembles anything of the original. I see why that would make many purist upset. That would help explain a current rating of 3.7, which is crazy considering all the far worse films with higher ratings. I was entertained watching this film but that is with the caveat that this was not a good or very well made movie. The film fell flat on the execution of creating a compelling narrative.The pepsi product placement rivaled the pepsi placement in the ""I will not bow to any sponsor"" scene in Wayne's World. ""Its like people only do things because they get paid, and its really sad"" -Garth."
adabe-28860,1,It's even worse than morbius,"Not even a funny disaster like thor: love & thunder but a boring disaster worse than morbius.After watching this disaster I think we all owe morbius a big apology.Don't mind the reviews it's even much worse than you think it is.Dear sony! Please stop making these trash movies for atleast 20 years.Look, you guys have done some good things. For sake of trying to create new tentpoles. You guys could do a Joint Operating Agreement to split revenues and profits but divest your creative teams from ever touching this stuff again.We don't need a movie every year. We don't need a TV show every three months.Make quality, not quantity.Wish the writers strike never ended. Wish directors strike and dont return."
JustARandomOutsider,1,Sony reaching a new low (how is that even possible?),"Congratulations. You blew me away. I had no conceivable idea that any movie company could make a film this bad without even trying. In fact, judging by the sloppiness of the movie's direction, writing, pacing, and character elements, I'm struggling to get around the fact that those crackheads at Sony Pictures weren't trying to break the all-time record for worst superhero movie ever made. Man, it's almost like it would've been better if Sony didn't hire the same writers for Morbius to write this movie's script. Unbelievable, right? Well, let's look on the bright side, we still have Kraven dropping this year, so Sony may have at least a little bit of redemption after this mess."
jtorch-11283,1,Garbage,"Don't waste your time, and money seeing this in theaters. I was fooled by the trailer which looked promising. All the action in the whole film ( a total of 2 scenes) is shown in the the trailer. The rest of the movie is just terrible acting trying to save an even worse scrip.I'm honestly not sure how this made it to the big screen. I'm not a cinema expert, but shouldn't someone have to view the finished product and give the O. K. At some point before it is ""audience ready?"" I feel like that step in the process was skipped. I don't know what Marvel had to do with this film, but it certainly isn't the Iron-Man-Marvel I keep hoping they will somehow revive.And to whom it may concern, ""my parents don't love me."" Is neither a solid backstory OR a strong character trait. I hope you eat a lot of money on this movie."
Lelix2603,7,They've done worse,"I don't understand the bad reviews is simply a movie to watch in the evening without worries , there are much worse movies with better reviews.The special effects are decent, the actors are adequate, perhaps if developed in episodes it would have been better.For example, The Marvels is much worse, in terms of script. If this film was released in cinemas 10 years ago it would certainly have been considered more positively, the era of cinecomics is coming to an end, unless some new idea comes along
I give a 7 to this film to conclude, as I repeat, it is not so worse than many other cinecomics."
darrelltill,1,Madame Pleb,"There is nothing good in this film. It's badly written - not just full of clichés but full of dialogue that is meant to sound like cliché superhero idioms yet butchered until they make no sense. It is nothing but a costume parade with players that are dead behind the eyes. You can tell that everybody involved knows it's going to be a stinker but they'd already signed on and it was too late. It would be great if this was the flop that made Disney rethink their output (I know, this is actually an SSU movie not an MCU movie, but they are all heading down the same path) but I fear it will take a few more. The solution is really simple - they need to adjust their hiring policy to include persons of talent."
r96sk,8,I genuinely had a fun time watching 'Madame Web'... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?,"Ouch, that average rating! I'm not going to lie though, I genuinely had a fun time watching 'Madame Web'... perhaps I should be keeping that fact quiet?I don't know what to say, I found it to be suitably entertaining. I'm sure there are plot holes aplenty (I noticed a few) and it probably makes zero sense/isn't a good adaptation compared to its source material or whatever but honesty... I don't care, it gave me enough enjoyment that I wasn't questioning anything about what I was watching.The cast are probably the key factors as to why I did enjoy this. I previously knew of Dakota Johnson but hadn't actually seen her in anything properly, I found her performance to be more than noteworthy and she spearheads the film strongly. The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are positives too.Tahar Rahim's antagonist, meanwhile, is poorly written and portrayed, though I personally thought the actor did a good job. I have no complaints with anyone who appears onscreen to be honest. Away from them, the pacing and score are also standouts.In my recollection of viewing this, I truthfully haven't got any issues with it. If it wasn't for the slight bad murmurs that I did hear about pre-watch (though not much of it as I avoid as much as I can with movies) and the reaction on sites like this post-watch, I'd not be questioning my thoughts about this whatsoever.As I always say, to each their own. For me, gimme a sequel (as long as the cast remain, mind). Not even sorry."
imdb-14761,6,Enjoyable. We had a good time.,"We saw this yesterday in the theater and we kept waiting to see how bad this was going to be. Yes, the soundtrack didn't match the lips for Tahar Rahim's character Ezekiel. In fact, we think he was miscast from the start. Very little personality and there are so many better options out there. I think they abruptly changed the dialog and script so much at the last minute, there was no choice but to dub over the voice instead of just reshooting the scenes - but it was painfully obvious when it was happening and really gave the movie an amateurish feel.This movie was set in the year 2003 and by all accounts, it felt as though it was MADE in 2003. It really did but I want to think that it was intentional and if it was, I appreciated it. It's old school, and the periodic attempts at humor or surprise worked in our opinion. We enjoyed the movie and happy we watched it.I'll be honest, I hope they actually make a sequel - just to see the other characters develop a bit more under Madame Web."
movieman6-413-929510,2,"Writers produce messy, tired work without really knowing what to do with it.","Madame Web is a new spin-off set in the Marvel Spider-Man world. This spin-off is directed, partly written and produced by S. J. Clarkson. Before this film, she directed more TV series episodes of superhero shows such as Jessica Jones and The Defenders.Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic in New York and learns after an accident that she has superpowers to see future possibilities. She sees that the lives of three girls are threatened by a mysterious masked man with spider-like powers.This is why she tries to protect the three girls and must convince them that their lives are really in danger. To truly protect them, they must ensure that the three listen to her and learn to work together.The story of this film has an interesting concept, but the final story and screenplay were written by five different writers. These writers do not always seem to have been on the same page, because the story sometimes seems a bit rushed or frayed. It sometimes seems as if they didn't really know what exactly to do with it, or what the film studio despised of them. The screenplay has also been rewritten many times, so the cast members could no longer always follow exactly where they were going or supposed to do with the film.Despite these messy, rushed aspects, the film remains on a familiar, predictable side for a superhero film. This can make the film seem a bit long-winded or embarrassing. The film is reminiscent of other superhero films that came out around the year 2000, but of a somewhat lesser quality.The visual effects don't always look believable either. The blue screen and CGI can be seen in the film. For some of the cast members, this was also the first time they had actually worked in a film with such visual effects. The fact that they have little or no experience with these film situations is sometimes reflected in their acting.The poor script also gives the cast members few opportunities to make something special of their roles. Dakota Johnson also seemed a bit uncomfortable during promotions of the film, or ignorant of how to properly promote this film. In the final film she tries to make the best of the role and tries to add some comedy to the role, but she doesn't always get the chance to do this. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor play the three girls Cassandra tries to protect. All three are given a little time to give their characters some personalities, but unfortunately not enough to make you as a viewer really care about the three. For a better focused film, they might have been better off using a character in the story, who Cassandra then has to protect. Tahar Rahim plays the villain in the film, who tries to kill the three girls, but also deals with the poor, weak script. As a result, he does not emerge as strongly as the villain of the story. They also didn't incorporate his audio work well into the film, because his lips sometimes don't always match what his character is saying.With all these superhero spin-off films from the Sony film studio, they only make Marvel's current film series more messy. If Sony and Disney Marvel try to collaborate on the same film series, they will have to consult each other more and better and plan where they want to go with this film series."
eddie_baggins,1,An all-time disasterpiece,"I'm not ashamed to admit I've seen some movies in my time.I am however ashamed to admit curiosity got the better of me and I ended up in an almost entirely empty cinema screening (thanks to one tolerant movie buddy who joined me on my trip to the local cinema) partaking in what can only be described as one of the most universally panned Hollywood blockbusters of the modern era.Not at all interested in watching another Sony Marvel outing after their last few efforts, hearing about the insanely awesome awfulness of Madame Web from friends, internet identities and esteemed critics made me want to witness a potential all-time cringe-fest and while when people are absolutely right in their hyperbole around just how bad Madame Web is, I'm still trying to comprehend how I could possibly testify to just how bad things are here.Directed by long time TV episode director S. J. Clarkson and featuring a cast of performers who have all proven over time to be more than capable of bringing the goods, Madame Web is not devoid of talent that may have been able to salvage some type of goodness from an offence against the entire cinematic medium but as a finished? (Honestly I am unsure how anyone could claim this is an acceptable final version, just watch for some of the most flawed examples of ADR you're ever going to see) product there was no one or any thing that could've saved this nightmare from the fate it had created for itself.An experience that could only possibly come from a collective group who all gave up the fight to save it long before shooting had wrapped, Madame Web inexcusably comes from the same penmanship that was guilty of unleashing Morbius on us but screenwriters Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless at least managed to find some cult like goodness in Jared Leto and Matt Smith's wildly OTT characters and bizarre action segments but Madame Web is nothing more than two hours of terrible plot, characters, spectacle and intentions and there is quite literally no valid reason for this movie to exist in the form it has been given.One of the most atrociously acted Hollywood films ever captured, with lead Dakota Johnson unable to hold back her disdain for a film she clearly hated being a part of and poor old Tahar Rahim taking the films most unfortunate mantle from a wigged Sydney Sweeney, Madame Web may have been promoted as some type of intense action thriller following the exploits of Johnson's Cassandra Webb as she battles Rahim's Ezekiel Sims alongside Sweeney's Julia, Isabela Merced's Anya and Celeste O'Connor's Mattie but we get something else entirely that is hard to come to terms with.From some of the most detestable and frequent examples of product placement that becomes instantly iconic (some viewers may find themselves attempting to crack open a Pepsi can in their Calvin Klein's after a viewing), a villain we literally know nothing about with zero attempts to bother explaining his plans or background, an embarrassing use of comic staple characters that aren't even put into action outside of dream sequences and a script that must surely have been conjured on ChatGPT, Madame Web is a cesspool of Hollywood excrement that isn't even funny in its horribleness, just merely sad and depressing.The only justifiable reason for Madame Web to be the film it is as it stands is if Sony are deliberately attempting to sabotage their Marvel property that no longer is allowed to include many fan favourites, if they aren't in fact doing that there is zero excuses for why Madame Web has ever been allowed to be birthed into existence.An irredeemable, amateurish and embarrassing exercise in pointless, Madame Web is a shockingly bad example of blockbuster filmmaking that is the exact type of bottom feeder product the cinema industry and the Marvel brand didn't need at this particular point of time.Final Say -If you're a glutton for punishment and want to be reminded of everything you wouldn't wish to see in a supposed piece of big screen entertainment then Madame Web is for you! A truly iconic new addition to the staples of all-time misfires, nothing could prepare one for the garbage that is this $80 million dollar disasterpiece.0 fireworks to the head out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)"
isaacsundaralingam,1,And you thought Morbius was bad,"Yea, this was garbage and that's saying plenty. It's actually adorable how little anyone cared about ""Madame Web"" - not just the audience, but the filmmakers and actors themselves. Written by the same people who wrote ""Morbius"", this movie is yet another reason to not let them anywhere near a writing software ever again.Not only was the movie unwatchable due to how lifeless it was, but it was also criminally boring. You're waiting for something to happen and you keep waiting right until the credits start to roll. Nothing about the movie was compelling, the plot was riddled with plot holes, the screenplay was lazy, the dialogues were dead and the acting was almost as if the actors were held captive and being forced to act as if everything was okay. It reeks of corporate greed and there isn't a single positive thing to say about this movie.We're only a month and half into the year and we already have a very strong contender for what might be the worst movie of the year, and it's not even close. Don't watch it, but if you do indeed decide to, I hope you lived a life well enough to have a crowded funeral."
markenglish-36610,1,Worst movie ever Sony please stop now stick to PlayStations only .,"It's the worst movie I've ever seen , it's a crime against cinemathe people at Sony must have money to burn to make this movie
it's simply bad the story if there is one nobody seems to know
The plot we think is a bad guy that has special Spider-Man powers chasing 3 girls & Johnson character had a dream about this - who writes these stories . We all Still didn't find out the name of the bad guy was ? I had to look it up later .It's even so bad Netflix won't want it .I was in a cinema last night with 4 people as well within 30 minutes 2 had already gone .Please Sony no more super hero movies stop now and stick to making PlayStationsDakota Johnson can't act it's been proven 50 shades of grey to this she has range it's over for her .It will go down as the worst movie of all time."
izadyardariush,1,Doomed,"I could tell from the beginning, making this movie was a bad idea. After I saw the cast I could tell this movie doomed. I have nothing against any of those actors but I must say casting a Dakota was a biggest mistake for the role! Anyone read the comics could say that. This movie was like terminator meeting final destination! No good story, big mess, lot of waste of potentials. I must say worst choice of villain! We have good movies, bad movies but like to watch but this was bad bad like that bad I was torturing myself to sit through the whole movie. I wonder do they even watch their movie?!!$"
kathkalcheva,7,Interesting ideas and story,"Somehow the movie gets a lot of bad reviews but that's unnecessary. It often gets compared to ""Morbius"", because that was trash but they literally have nothing in common.""Madame Web"" is entertaining, has a unique backstory and introduces some ideas that maybe get lost to major public. To name a few:
ideas about the unlimited power of the mind and how, if it's used properly, it can even shape the physical realityteaches us to follow our intuition (which, if you pay attention, also shows us kind of glimpses into the future)female empowerment and the importance of teamworkJust go see the movie and make up your own mind."
alindsayal,1,One of the worst Comic Book Films Ever,"With Marvel Studios taking on more responsibility involving Spider-Man, Sony have decided to try and build a universe involving smaller characters from the same lore as him. We have had Venom and Morbius and will get Kraven The Hunter later this year but here we have Madame Web. I saw this film last night and here is my review for Madame Web. The p[remise of the film sees a women bestowed with powers where she has to save 3 girls from being killed by a villainous foe.Main Character
I must be honest that I have never been a huge fan of Dakota Johnson and she plays Cassandra Web here and I have to be honest she isn't particularly good here. She is overacting everything here and her character is super unlikeable and hard to care about. She is clearly hampered by the awful writing in this film and she can't rise above it and give us a lead role to support or care about and Cassie Web will go down as one of the worst leads in a comic book film ever.Supporting Characters
Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced & Celeste O'Connor play the three girls that are in the view of the villain and they are all pretty awful. Their characters are really awkward and not particularly likeable, the film tries to force you to like and care about these characters but it comes across poorly and these actresses aren't good enough to make me care.Tahar Rahim plays Ezekiel Sims and he is one of the more frustrating parts of this film because I have seen him be a good actor and this character had some potential but the film really flops here and makes him this over the top villain that is so stupid that it really takes you out of the film.Adam Scott as Ben Parker is probably the best person here but he isn't really given much to do and it still upsets me that he plays Ben Parker and it is really clear that this was just done to provide some stupid fan service that actually annoys me even more.Story
The story is nonsensical and completely stupid. The plot makes no sense and characters do things that make no sense, Cassie Web in particular is one of the dumbest characters that I have seen in recent movies. This film also tries its best to ruin the character of Spider-Man even though he isn't in the film and it is just the backdrop to this pretty dull and horrendous adventure.Script
This is a really awfully written film. Things make no sense, characters are unlikeable and there is no humour here at all. There are so many plot holes it is crazy and the film has nothing interesting about it at all.Style
I mean I guess the action scenes are okay and the bad guys suit was okay but that is it. The film is filmed really poorly, the editing looks unfinished and at times it is actually quite jarring to watch it. There are way too many jump scares especially for a film that is not a horror film. The trailer shows things that barely happen in the film and it feels like we were sold a different film that never got made.Overall
Overall, Madame Web is a truly disastrous film. This is up there with one of the worst films I have ever seen and is up there with the worst comic book films of all time. Though I am glad I saw this film to have this experience but at all cost avoid this garbage and do something better for 2 hours.Rating - 1/10."
Louisejjames,8,I liked it!,"I read all the reviews about this film before I went to see it and was expecting a cross between a 70's B movie and The Brothers Grimm, which is IMHO the worst film I've ever seen. Watching it I really don't see where all the dislikes come from, sure it had an unsure time during the making of the movie but it's a long way from the disaster many people would have you believe.It has a decent villain, some great special effects, none of the lead characters whilst not being especially oscar-worthy was awful and the plot, although a little convoluted at times, was pretty good. It's set up to lead onto a sequel, of course, although by the sounds of it it probably wont get one which would be a shame because where it's leading to has, at least, some promise.My advice would be to see this film with an open mind and ignore all the hate. Who knows, you might actually enjoy it!"
qbsjsnp,7,Not sure what all the hate is about.,"I just finished watching the movie everyone apparently hated and I have to say...why? It was entertaining, had backstory, acting was good, and it has Adam Scott. Was it the same level watch as Endgame? No. But I also didn't watch it to compare. I watched it to be entertained and it did its job. Perhaps you could try not hate-watching it and see if y'all enjoy it more. You missed out with your preconceived expectations and forgot that it was not meant to be the best experience of your life, but rather a fun evening with a mostly female cast. Or is that the reason for the low ratings? I guess you are the only one who can answer that."
vengeance20,2,It's Bad.,"Ok, so before people come at me with the ""YoU dIdN't LiKe It BeCaUsE iT wAs FeMaLe LeAd."" chestnut. I went into this one with an open mind, but expecting it to be as described & the reviews were right. The film is bad.The film sees Cassandra Webb who is a New York metropolis paramedic who begins to demonstrate signs of clairvoyance. Forced to challenge revelations about her past, she needs to safeguard 3 young girls from a deadly adversary who wants them destroyed.I found the film to be pretty bad. It's disjointed, clunky, poorly paced & just feels very awkward & stiff. The characters are personality-less, they look & sound as if they're reciting their lines from cue cards (almost robotic, I might add) & the script reads like a supermarket shopping receipt.The films story is all over the place, confusing & hard to follow. The premonition sequences the main lead experiences were annoying & while creative, were repetitive to the point where you couldn't tell if she was hallucinating or actually seeing what she was seeing.The films runtime is overly long for what it is, while not as bad as other films which are generally over 2 hours (rolls eyes), this film felt longer & as I said was too long for what it was at 1 hour & 48 minutes (108 minutes) without credits & the pacing, jeez... don't get me started.The actors were alright, but what they were given script wise, didn't work & made them come across as flat. There's some action & not bad effects to be had, but that's pretty much the only redeeming features from this flick, sadly. It hasn't a lot going for it & is pretty lack luster & basic.Don't get me wrong, I prefer films with straight forward story-lines & plots you can follow, but this one was a bit too basic & could've used more meatiness to beef it up more as well as more emphasis to keep the audience engaged with the story, characters, action etc.I generally didn't like the film & the ending is just out there too & is pretty cringy like some of the scenes in the film as well as the few cringy action sequences themselves among some of the good action we got.Overall, it's a bad film. And no, it's got nothing to do with the old chestnut of me being a man who doesn't like the film because it's female lead. The film was bad & had plenty of things wrong with it. People in general, men & women, boys & girls, didn't like this flick.The story is bland, boring & paper thin like the characters & leads, the little bit of good action & effects seen are overshadowed by the aforementioned issues as well as the other issues like the poor runtime, pacing & the lacking engagement the film has.Also, for those who can't seem to get it in their heads, there's been plenty of female lead films in the past that have done well, from the Alien Franchise to The Hunger Games along with Elektra, Tomb Raider, Salt, Lucy, Hanna etc. I could go on but that's my rant for those who need calling out.2/10."
avinashsaha-85994,5,NOT A GOOD NOR A BAD ONE,"Not a good movie nor a bad one, yes the script is loose and story telling was little slow, the Spiderman movies are actually exciting, but this one actually was boring .. writers need to understand that as a viewer we want to connect with the lead with their back story too... No need to rush ... Madame Web could be the game changer, but sorry ... It's not your best, the good thing was new spider senses, action scene, intense ending and the some of the part in the middle was good.. but it can be better.. next time if you introduce any character to mcu no need to rush, and those other 3 characters were useless in this movie, the whole movie was revolving around those but writer need to understand that how to use them, It felt weird and pathetic..."
lysletters98275,1,A big no,"I don't know how the writers didn't see that this was a bad idea. The script, the performance, the cast together everything was bad.I don't know if is Dakota who is pain people or something, because how can someone review this movie and say that Dakota deserves an Oscar. How??? I the others critics saying ""not even Dakota could save this movie"" she is one of the reasons that was bad, she is not in that status like Olivia Colman or Octavia Spencer.People have saying that would be a bad movie because the writers are the same that Morbius; have nothing to do with being a female lead movie and Sony please just give up, just give us Spider-Man is not to much to ask.And they knew the movie was bad that is why just have one trailer and the gap between the premier and the release to theaters was so short.I just want to see who is the next abandoning the ship, because Dakota have already left after saying that was not the script she read.People are more into read the bad reviews of this movie then actual see the movie, this how bad this movie is."
rgkarim,5,A Messy Web Of Mediocrity,"LIKES:The Commentary At Times
-Some lines in this movie are startling at how funny they were for me, a fantastic bout of teenage emotions with a less than thrilled babysitter.-Madame Web's origin story is almost like an anti-hero tale to Charles Xavier idea, and though it's not fully fleshed out, there is emotion, fun, and what felt natural angst and vulnerability into it.-With the right timing, and build up, this section of commentary was a striking positive in this reviewers book.Representation of Paramedics
-It's a rare thing to get to actually see E. M. T's in their work and what they give to serve the public.-While a bit forced, and perhaps a tad overdone and cheesy, kudos for Madame Web accomplishing some detailed shots of them serving the public and giving a little character development with it.-There were great avenues taken to help ingrain parts into the story, and with that, the medical nerd inside me found a cool little nod in those sequences.Some Artistic Visuals Are Cool
-I'm a sucker for a good shot and a good artistic visual popping out and ingraining itself into my mind.-Madame Web has some of these moments for me, the creepy and yet serene world of the Web World, being one that holds majesty and mystery, but also the very emotions of the person trying to wield it.-Other shots of costume crusaders striking that right pose, or perhaps that nostalgic early 2000s look, really help establish some of the themes of the movie or a good set up visual to cascade into.-It may be sprinkled about, but there were some superhero visuals that accomplished the job for me in Madame Web.Talented Cast
-Celeste O'Connor is very fun in this movie. A tad quirky, but she keeps the attitude going, a lot of that sass very fun and usually well-placed to help move the story towards forced comedy and obvious story telling.-Merced eventually grew on me after she got into the meat of her character and starting to push past the stubborn and cheeky attitude. She's got charming charisma, a fun brainy side to exploit, and this sadness that she uses to illicit such emotion, something I wanted more of, but got only little.-Sweeney is fun in this movie. Toned down from the other roles I've seen, the woman knows how to adapt her style and give me something to hook to several times. I love the awkwardness she brings, the tie in to the two extremes, and her surprising smallness after she plays such big roles.-And Johnson is about the same as she always is. A snarky and condescending nature that she wields expertly, but a tad dry at times that some lines feel unfulfilled. Fortunately, she's got good chemistry with the girls that assisted in smoothing out the faults.Some Surprising Character Arcs
-The movie may miss a lot of things, but there are a few moments that work very well to show the potential of Madame Web if given the right focus.-An opening that holds some merit was one of the victories, something that would eventually bleed into plot points further on that gave you a very touching moment.-And another element has the other's origin stories granting us some potential hurt and relatable tales to latch onto and acknowledge. Again, helping give a young and in your face Charlie's Angel group some vim and vigor.The Music
-Call me a sucker for nostalgia, Madame Web has a mix of songs that were perfect for viewers like me to enjoy.-Comedic use of the songs are not the most creative, but add that minor element to help give the girls a little more dynamic and believability.-While other times, it's just a blast of the speakers and me dancing in my seat as the forgotten wonder returns for another run to get things started.DISLIKES:The Pacing Uneven
-Despite the trinkets and some merits to the story, Madame Web's dislikes for me start with the pacing of the tale.-A moderately slow start did little to keep me engaged, only to then have these sprints of faster moments to try to change things up, before hitting the brakes again.-Like a CW season crammed into one, Madame Web's pacing feels a lot like dressed up teenage drama trying to give realism and gradual steps, but really just being the mashup of the uglier time use dramas can get stuck to.The Stale Mechanic
-From the trailers, you know there is some type of vision gimmick that Cassie is supposed to use to protect her charges.-That gimmick gets stale very quickly for a viewer like me, the convoluted presentation starting out fun at first, but then turning into annoying déjà vu that felt more like reshoots than actual artistic twisting.-Like Moon Knight, that element makes sense at first, but really could have stopped halfway through the movie once the viewers has connected the powers.-Had there been a bit more excitement, fighting, or even better storytelling to distract, it would have been less impactful, but alas, for me, all the other limitations added up.Lack of Other Character Development
-There are a lot of characters in this movie, some played by bigger names than the leads themselves. And yet, their time and character development felt shoehorned than planned out.-Adam Scott and Emma Roberts seem disengaged, with stories that are cliché, simplistic, and a waste of talent that again showed potential with that slower pacing at the start.-But even the villain and main girls tales feel very bland, and that lack of character development was very much felt by me that it almost seems to rely heavily on another movie to do these characters justice.Annoying Dialogue
-I know, I said the commentary was good, but that was a small amount of it compared to the whole.-Madame Web's dialogue seems to have gone through the writing grinder several times, very loaded with one liners, sassy comments and attitude that seemed to be out of place for much of the film for me.-Statements of the obvious, corny dialogue essentially pushed in with too simplistic of writing and in your face, overdramatic flair to count as quality dialogue. It needs tuning up, needs to be less forceful, and try to add a little Hollywood magic to help tenderize it to something matching a comic book movie.A Villain Needing A Lot More
-Don't get me wrong, there is an element to him that is relatable, believable, and indeed threatening in terms of the madness of his actions.-But outside of this and the opening scene, Ezekiel is a very bland bad guy who just didn't get the time to shine outside of crawling and repeating the same lines over and over.-The direction failed to give him any recognizable skills, his threats empty most of the time and sort of creepy obsessive, and dare I say his actual character is zoomed over and practically absent but for the opening line.-To me, that's a limited villain and one major flaw that much of the movie suffers from.Visuals Get Really Muddy/Bad
-Sony makes such great looking video games, and yet their movies still suffer from last gen effects
-While the artistic flair of those moments was enjoyable, they did have that faux effect that dropped some of the realism this movie was going for.-Even worse, there are lots of movements, character renderings, and powers that leave a lot to be desired in looking their best. I won't say it's a dealbreaker, but it doesn't help to have such limited technology presentation.Scenes/Story Seem Very Chopped Up
-Between the gimmicks and pacing, the scenes already feel limited, messy, and almost like an abbreviated version of what they could be.-Sure, the dialogue gives you everything they are going for, but the presentation felt very much like a lot of reshoots of the same scene, and slight changes that made little difference.-Such indecisive direction and edits got away from them and left me just wondering what this film could have been with half the gimmicks of the visions pulled back.The Action Is Very Boring
-No denying this, Madame Web maybe even worse than many of the CW attempts at action.-While witty, and an amusing game of cat and mouse, a Spiderverse without a solid one or two fights is a verse I'm not fond playing in for nearly two hours.-A lame villain does little but strut and crawl, while our cast somehow running away and eluding comes off a bit pathetic than entertaining.-Even the climax is a mess, rushed finishes, suspense of disbelief, and an overdramatic battle of words with a very extravagant and mushy ending to cap it off.-Eternals at least had a few moves that had me rocking in my seat, but this... this was a challenge to stay awake in.The VERDICT:
Madame Web is certainly not the worst movie I've seen in years, but that doesn't mean Sony's latest is a masterpiece either. There are elements of this vision that show the potential for a good future, but need a lot of work to make up for this rushed installment. A talented cast, music and some fun writing can be the starting building blocks, but it can't offset what feels like lots of production limitations, rewrites, and editing that greatly show in this movie. Boring battles, annoying gimmicks, and under developed characters despite a strong cast were just some of the limitations this movie has to work through if a series is to come with it. Should one see it in theaters? Not really. A shot at home, I would say sure, but with all of this, my scores for the movie are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 6.0
Movie Overall: 5.0."
cosby_don,1,WORST FILM IN THE HISTORY OF CINEMA,"I don't know where to start-actually, I do! THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY. I'm not kidding.I'm not sure what other movie this Dakota Johnson has been in, but after watching THIS movie, I'll probably never support her again. This was an absolute career killer. Ms. Johnson, please FIRE your agent immediately.To the production crew, editors, director, and ESPECIALLY the writers (I counted 4 writers-that's RIDICULOUS), shame on you for contributing to this mess. It's obvious you've traded in your morals for a paycheck. That's Hollywood for ya'.Did I mention that this movie was HORRENDOUSLY bad? Everything about this movie was bad-there are ZERO redeeming qualities.The story: STUPID. Worst I've ever seen, seriously. Madam Web ask the girls to wait for 3 hours in the woods? STUPID. The guy partner keeping the girls as Madam Web flies to Peru to check something out. STUPID. Madam a Web getting her powers from a spider bite through her mother. STUPID. I could seriously go on and on. I'm not kidding-EVERYTHING in this movie was STUPID. I can't count how many times I shook my head and said ""This is so bad.""The acting? Very wooden. Ms. Dakota Johnson's acting chops were the worst of the worst here. I really pray that she's done work much better. The other girls-they tried. Jokes fell flat, and they said the DUMBEST lines ever in a movie. I was seriously angry at how dumb they were.The villain? The most generic, uninteresting, uncool villain over ever seen on film. Not one memorable quote. Come to think, did he even make a ""evil guy"" speech? Nope!The ending? Oh my, HORRENDOUS. She's smiling in her glasses while paralyzed in a wheel chair? MAN WHI WROTE THIS MESS??The girls weren't even in costume more than 2 minutes of the entire film, even though in the trailer we came to expect them to be crime fighters and kicking butt in the film. WTF!Sydney Sweeney. You're good looking. Please do not EVER put out junk like this again!"
kmkevinn-64733,5,"Not a bad Marvel Film, this could use some makeup homework assignments.","Not a bad film. I did appreciated Marvel's bad films because I like watching bad Marvel films because to me they're better than highly-grossed films. MADAME WEB could use extra homework assignments. Dakota Johnson & Sidney Sweeney are both horrible actors choice and characters developments. Dialogue and ADR was putting ice on a frier machine at a fast food restaurant. The Villian wasn't so bad could use some work with his homework assignments. Overall experience was decent not the best, but hey at least Marvel tries is best with CGI which they did. I found that fascinating. Other characters choices besides Ben Parker were just disappointed. Using FUTURE as a death, Why would this film borrows early death before happening lets say Final Destination? I don't get it."
ezriderz,7,Much better than the reviews suggest,"I enjoyed this movie. It is a teen girl oriented movie; ala Suicide Squad meets Nancy Drew. I have to admit that Suicide Squad was a better movie. Some sensitive people might find the few violent scenes harder to watch.While Madame Web is not a great movie, it is certainly watchable and it held my interest throughout. I'm not a super critical movie critic, and I do like to be entertained. I often like less complicated movies that are not difficult to follow.This movie was entertaining and never boring. The special effects seemed a bit extreme and unrealistic, but aren't they usually so?Don't be afraid to give this movie a watch if you'd like to see Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney show off their girl-power.I gave it 1 extra star in sympathy for all the horrible reviews."
ericknromero,5,Future tense,"Not nearly as bad as I expected from everything I've heard. Not great, but not terrible. I can see why there has been such widespread disdain of the movie, because the overall quality of it is mid (as the kids say today), and it may be even more insulting to the hardcore comic fans, but it had the basic pieces of an entertaining movie.I think what I liked most was how it grounded a mythological story, including a main character who learns she can see the future, while still being able to insert some heart into the center. And except maybe for the opening scene, the writing and acting were fairly decent. I even thought the pacing and direction of the story made sense.Yes, there were dozens of head-scratching moments about why certain characters made certain choices, particularly the villain, but not enough to tank the experience for me. I think this is the director's first major motion picture; I looked up S. J. Clarkson and she mostly has directed TV shows. I'm good with Sony Pictures giving people a chance, but I do sometimes wonder why they do it with origin story movies of beloved comic book characters. Seems risky.This was my first Dakota Johnson movie. I've heard her name a bunch but I hadn't seen anything with her in it prior to this role of Cassandra Webb. She was great the whole way through. Not until I looked her up after the movie did I know she was the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson. The fact that I remember when those two got together, and that Dakota is currently 34 years old, means I'm old.The rest of the cast was fine. Again, I honestly don't think this movie was bad. If I had to rate it, then maybe a 5 out of 10? Perfectly average, and there's nothing wrong with that.And a bonus: Dakota Johnson looks great in jeans."
sam_asher,7,Not as bad as people who want to jump on the hate train make out!,"It does come across a bit dated, but it is set in the early 00s!The female leads are likeable, especially Dakota Johnson, it's the actor who plays the villain that chews every scene he's in like he's starving!!He's up there as one of THE worst villains (not in a good way) ever.Switch off and try any be a kid for a moment, don't overthink as if you're that kid.Other than the villian being extremely miscast, Emma Roberts is miscast as Peter Parker/ SpiderMan's mother to be (she comes across vapid & verging on mean girl).The guy who plays Ben Parker was dull, considering he's playing a beloved character.I've seen way worse movies get much better reviews.It just seems to be ""in"" to hate this movie and there was a lot of hate towards it before it even started shooting!"
xturnandforfeitx,5,Movie Getting Review Bombed,"By no means is this a great movie. But on a true 10 star scale, 5 means average, and that still counts for something.I truly can't say that there are outrageous problems with the film. There is a set-up to a character with some background, a villain with a reasonable motivation, and a protagonist who needs to learn her strengths to overcome a stronger protagonist.Trailers were definitely a bait and switch where they eluded to a much different film, so I can understand some disdain there, but that doesn't means this is a 1/10.I'd watch this again over Morbius, and I genuinely think that movie is worse."
Shokani,5,Somewhat good movie,"It was actually a bit good contrary to all these people comparing it to morbuis.The colour grading was very good and an eye candy.The plot was intriguing though some loose ends ruined it a great deal, childishness was also present in the plot,to have a good movie tha actually appeals to many adults and children,it should have deep plot lines and dialogues.Other than that,the editing was good, except in the last part on the building,there was fake CGI there.Overall,it was an enjoyable movie,and the camera work was freaking good,seamless transitions was a job well done.Overall,you should watch this movie because It was enjoyable,sure it had its many flaws but I promise you,the reviews are lying to you."
rkudera,5,Not too bad,"In assessing the value of ""Madam Web,"" one must consider the film not just as a standalone project but as a potential starting point for a much larger narrative arc. The Spider-Man multiverse is a complex and richly woven tapestry, full of diverse characters, storylines, and themes. Introducing Madam Web as a character and potential narrative pivot offers a fresh vantage point from which to explore this universe. The character's unique abilities and her position within the Spider-Man lore can serve as a conduit for new stories, characters, and even dimensions within the franchise.Furthermore, the criticism regarding the movie's direction might overshadow the film's accomplishments. For instance, the casting decisions, visual effects, and adherence to the source material are areas where ""Madam Web"" possibly shines. These elements, when combined with the movie's narrative potential, suggest a promising future for the series. It's crucial to recognize that many successful franchises have had humble beginnings, with initial skepticism giving way to widespread acclaim as the series evolved."
adhithyakuttan,5,Not a total disaster,"While ""Madame Web"" won't be winning any awards, it's not the cinematic disaster some reviews might have you believe. Dakota Johnson brings a certain charm to Cassie Webb, and the film's exploration of precognition is a unique twist on the superhero origin story.The fun unravels a bit during the climax. It feels rushed and underwhelming, failing to deliver the punch a superhero film needs. The action sequences throughout are decent but forgettable.However, to dismiss the entire movie based on the ending feels harsh. The concept is interesting, and Johnson's performance is engaging.Is it a groundbreaking superhero movie? No. But as a person who is font for super hero movies, for a casual watch with a moderately intriguing premise, ""Madame Web"" isn't a total waste of time. Just don't get your hopes up for an epic finale."
xxxGH0STZxxx,1,2 Hours I Can't Get Back,"My girlfriend, a Marvel fanatic, dragged me to this movie. Although apprehensive, I owed her one, and we went. It was a completely nonsensical and incoherent movie. The acting was terrible, and I remember laughing at supposedly serious dialogue because it was delivered so awkwardly.Madame Web is a NYC paramedic, and they show many scenes of her utilizing her medical skills. I counted; the characters in this film go 4/4 on cardiac resuscitation using simple chest compressions. For those who don't know, chest compressions are used when the heart has stopped, and you are essentially pumping blood for the patient until you can get the heart started again. You get the heart pumping again using an AED, assuming you have a shockable rhythm. In real life, CPR has a success rate of 10%. Without AEDs or breathing into the lungs to oxygenate, they went 100% on CPR. Incredible! What was I expecting from a movie about a clairvoyant woman and a Spiderman? I'm not sure, but the filmmakers could do some research into their main character.Also, the product placement was out of control. The entire movie was essentially an ad for Pepsi products. The final fight scene takes place on a giant Pepsi-Cola sign. It was so in your face. It was just icing on the cake.It's a typical Sony superhero movie. 2 hours, and nothing really happens. You're better off just getting it on streaming."
kevinmccormack16,5,Could've been written better -but entertained Me,"Firstly, I'm sure that a lot of people will pick holes in this Marvel offering, however, you need to suspend your sense of disbelief, as the telling of the story involved Us being part of the premonition process -which involved a great deal of imaginative writing, which I think worked well, mostly.The sequal (which I'm sure is intended to happen) will be better received -after all, Spiderman had to start somewhere, didn't he! Of course, parallels will be drawn between the conceiving of Madam Web and Spidey! But go easy on the girls, as I've a premonition that they will return fighting fit Ok."
alashiq-95615,6,Give it a shot!,"I think this movie got deserve a higher rating. Dont understand why it got so low rating. Really unfair!Since the film is one of the low-budget films, it deserves a better rating than this one. The film would be more successful if it were a series, but as a film it is acceptable and better than many other films i watched. The cast in general is better at the beginning of the film, but the end of the film was a bit strange. Choosing the main roles should have been more wise. Casting reckless and unqualified young girls dropped a number of stars because the film became more of a ""children's film"" than an adult film. In general, the film is acceptable, and I enjoyed watching it, especially at the beginning, and the choice of songs and music was enjoyable."
scornix,1,Yikes!!!,"This was bad on another level!! Where do I even start? The plot holes, the acting, the cinematography, the effects... all so bad! Like what was up with those zoom in zoom out camera movements? Did they try to cast the worst actor possible for the villain? And it seems like he couldn't deliver a single line on camera! It was all ADR! Maybe this was supposed to be a parody and we're all missing the point? Idk. But if you want to watch it, watch it high or drunk otherwise it'll be disappointing. I'd put this movie right next to Room. Maybe one day it'll be a cult classic just because of how ridiculously bad it was! Lol. Hope you have a great time. Don't forget those brownies."
hoelzl-73115,8,Good movie -- I don't understand all the bad reviews,"I just watched the movie and I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. I wasn't too sure about what to expect because the average rating isn't great, but reading through some reviews on here after watching (which I didn't do before), I can't really understand all the hate.Everyone seems to be mentioning Pepsi cans and that this movie is supposedly just one big advertisement for it, but I didn't notice it all while watching. Not once did I consciously perceive a can.I also don't think the writing was bad nor did the actors do such an awful job as everyone is saying they did. Maybe I'm not as critical as others, but I didn't notice a difference to most other films I watched. The did some acting, I didn't once think ""wow this is bad acting"", ergo it was fine.The only thing I missed a bit was an explanation of why the villain became a villain. Some more background on that would have helped understand his actions and why he's doing what he's doing.In the beginning of the movie he just says something along the lines of ""Nobody helped my family when they were starving either"". Seemed a little cheap of a reason to go on and become a villain, so I suppose you just have to accept him to be a villain for the sake of there being a villain.All in all I found it to be a good movie. I don't usually write reviews, but given all these negative ones I felt they didn't reflect how I perceived it at all."
nizarsalim,7,Not as Bad as the Reviews Say About it,"Madame Web is not as bad as people and critics say because it has a number of elements that deserve praise. The performance of Johnson, Sweeney, Merced, O'Connor, and Rahim, story, direction, screenplay, cinematography, and soundtrack, all deserve praise, even though they are not the best that can be seen in a superhero movie.Regarding the flaws, what I didn't like is the visual and sound effects, action scenes, which were not so many, some confusing story elements, and the lack of connection to the spidermen charactersIn general, I enjoyed Madame Web, even though it is not the best Marvel movie that can be seen these days. But at least, I see it better that Morbius. That is why when it comes to the score, I give Madame Web 7 out of 10."
someotherperson,1,How can someone re-hire these writers after Morbius?,"I'm at a loss for words. I don't understand how hollywood works but I'm sure these dudes either have dirty on someone high up or actually paid to be part of this. It is not possible to hire someone that wrote Morbiues and think ""oh well, hope it works this time"". It doesn't. Plus, why does this feel like a direct-to-DVD movie mashed with a bad CW tv show?Just to explain how bad this movies was, not even Sidney's bust could make it interesting. Yes, that bad.Avoid at all costs, send these 2 dudes to a goolag and never mention their names again. Send the lady director back to making c-level tv shows.The acting is bad but I blame on the writers, not the actresses. Poor creatures were dealt a bad hand..."
shaikhirshad-41223,2,Morbius is gold in front of Madame Web. (End of discussion).,"Literally I had zero expectations when I went to watch this flick but I still thought that something should be good in this to watch at least one time because of marvel name in it. But this movie is so low and looks like low budget CGI thriller and a comedy in the name of superhero genre.I mean from the start itself movie lost it's pace and story and god only knows what are they showing no interest in the screenplay and the plot is not even engaging to watch for at least 30 mins.I only went for Dakota & Sydney just because the screen presence of them looks good, but the director loss this opportunity too. Because the character they're playing is so bad and not even proper dialogues are given and just they have made a common character with no story arc just the situation that they have to act
I've never seen such a bad cinematography of any film it looks like they don't have any interest making this film so they just made a spoof just to show that we are making a movie. Don't know what to say more because this film is that bad.Overall a Boring fest and a spoof fo a superhero genre."
Voltage_Spike,2,CW TV Pilot That Didn't Get Picked Up,"Unlikeable characters who seem to want out of these movie more than the audience. Scenes that are shot to be as confusing as possible with no artistic merit. I'm pretty sure every line of the bad guy's dialog was dubbed.The movie _really_ wants you to know that it's set in 2003. And to prove it, they take the bold decision to ignore lessons learned from every superhero movie after the original X-Men.But Adam Scott gives a good performance. And I guess it proves _Morbius_ could have been _really_ bad rather than just mediocre.I see value in almost every movie. I watched the Birds Of Prey TV show. I now understand what it means to want your time back."
KatarBlade,1,Just Avoid,Saw movie today and went in with fingers crossed movie would be okay. Oh how I was wrong. It's not good when you start losing interest in the first 20-30 minutes.Acting is so wooden and bad. Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson in particular. One scene in a forest has Sweeney reciting lines like she is literally reading verbatim from cue card. Acting so wooden I expected David Attenborough to start narrating.Also don't expect superheroes or powers. You see maybe 2-3 minutes of actual powers by the spider-ladies. The rest is hinky misty scenes of Madame Web seeing the threads. The scenes in trailer of spider-ladies are very quick visions.I'd say this is the worst superhero movie I've seen. Avoid it or at least wait until on streaming service you subscribe to.
seven-johnson,1,Masterpiece!!!,"Finally, a film, cast, Director and studio ready to nail the coffin shut on the superhero-cash-cow ""genre"" and they tackle the challenge with gusto.There was possibly a director, although you might not know it if you've watched the film and could easily just assume this was al AI-algorithm, apparently that directors done other film that I would try to avoid, but I can't remember their name.There's nepo-baby Johnson and absolute personality vacuum - but she's perfected her acting chops since 50 Shades... so, completely wooden and forgettable. Token black girl and token latin girl and Sidney Sweeney - she's the eye-candy, sadly not an actress too though, she'd probably be a great promo-girl for an owl-sounding food chain, but she's out of her depth in everything I've seen her in.CGI which... should have been better even if it came out a decade ago.There's a villain - Ezekiel, at least poignant timing for the etymology of that name and that's it really.There's some explosions and other loud noises, but whilst being the best thing about this stinker, they're also ""retro""/would have been ""ok"" a decade ago.I for one welcome our new AI overlords, at least it can't make films worse than this."
jacobturner-76379,2,Clickbait,This movie is basically just clickbait. All the marketing for this movie advertises four superheroes facing off against one bad spider person. Despite this three of the characters don't have powers in this movie and are only seen using their powers in visions of the future. The action was mediocre at best and the dialogue was extremely wooden. The characters constantly make stupid decisions and no one seems to care as they just go about their business. The comedy was by far the best part of this movie and all of the three other people in the cinema seemed to agree. I went into this movie expecting it to be a cheesy superhero movie and was still left disappointed. But I will probably watch it again because I love bad movies.
wdsmith-64817,7,Not nearly as bad as I was led to believe,"Not knowing anything about the source material, I found the movie entertaining and would love to see the story expanded upon in sequels. It may not be 100% accurate to the comics, but this is Marvel and Spiderman, where multiverses canonically exist with their own variances.Action scenes were thrilling. Setup was not too predictable for the casual fan. You can see where they're setting up for additional stories, subtle nods here and there to well established lore.If you're a casual fan or fan of movies versions of superheros, not taken aback by women as lead characters, and Pepsi product placement does offend you, give this movie a watch. It might not be Avengers: Endgame levels of spectacle nor might it be anyone's favorite Sony Marvel movie, but it is a good movie to waste an afternoon on."
jeffsplanetx,1,"This has to stop, maybe it's time to quit the day job.","When the director admits not knowing or researching the source material we are in for a treat that's for sure. Not just that but the acting seems to have had little direction as well.I don't write many reviews, mainly as I have terrible grammar skills and my spelling is just awful! So I know limits. Maybe the makers or this film should take a lesson from my book and give up on something they are clearly not good at!Leaving Adam Scott out of this as he flawlessly did his part, what there was of it. Dakota Johnson has never given me much of an idea she can act at all but this was on another level. I am surprised at the 3 girls having seen them in other things and being good! It seriously is as if the director just went ""that will do"" on the first take every time.And yes it makes a difference, look at any Arnold performance when he is in a James Cameron film! You actually see acting.The villain was weak, the story was weaker and the mess will leave you with a very bad taste in your mouth. I am all for a superhero movie with Girl power being the obvious motivation behind it but how about coming up with an original all new line up and some bloody thought behind the story, you might actually have something then!"
whiskeymovie,7,It was a perfectly fine movie,"It's seems that these days people just want to haterate movies, especially movies that are worn or POC centric.This was a generic superhero movie hitting all the usual beats. It was a little unfocused in places and some things didn't flow like they should have, but all in all, I was never bored watching this film.Dakota Johnson has proven she can act quite well but she has a dry delivery, which people will ether like or hate. I personally like it.I also think they did a disservice by including the 3 young girls. It should have focused more on Cassie coming into her own with her new powers. Or maybe have only had one of the girls and focus more building their characters. I also wasn't a huge fan of the way Cassie was ""blinded"". It felt kind of, lazy? But ither than that, I enjoyed it."
penguin-65,1,Yes it really is that bad,"There are no consecutive 10 seconds of this film that will hold your attention. Whether by plot stupidity, bad dialogue, or clunky cinematography you will constantly be thrown out of the movie and back into the theater (and wishing you weren't there)Every actor reads their lines as if English is not their native languageThe villains lines are clearly dubbed, seemingly by Richard Dreyfuss with his balls in a viceThe grand evolution of Cassandra's powers allow her to helpful pat people on the back and say they'll be okay (that isn't a spoiler, I promise)Does the final fight take place somewhere iconic like the statue of liberty? No. It takes place on a Pepsi billboardNeed a lead for your girl power film? Hire the submissive from 50 shades...There was 1 good line in the entire film."
exceladeogun,5,Better than the reviews stated,"Madame webMadame Web emerges as the origin tale of Cassie Webb. Her quest leads her to rescue three girls from the clutches of Ezekiel Sims, a ruthless figure intent on their demise to evade his own fate at their hands in the future.Films in Sony's Spider-Man universe have received criticism, and Madame Web isn't exempt from that. However, contrary to many reviews, Madame Web is a straightforward and enjoyable superhero film. It doesn't aim for grandeur, which aligns well with its storyline. Despite uninspiring dialogue hinted at in trailers, the actual movie doesn't suffer from this. Though not particularly imaginative, the dialogue effectively propels the story forward.The film effectively captures the nostalgia of its 2003 setting. The soundtrack plays a significant role in this, and the homage to Beyoncé's ""Dangerously In Love"" was a delightful touch.Madame Web does indeed encounter several challenges. The unfolding of subplots relies too heavily on convenient occurrences, which can be frustrating for viewers. While the exploration of the titular character's powers is intriguing, it diminishes the suspense that should accompany this genre of film. As obstacles arise, the predictability of their resolution removes any sense of genuine tension or dread.For a superhero movie where the principal characters are battling a villain palpably stronger and possessing no impressive powers of their own, the action scenes manage to be more effective than one would expect.The performances in this film may not be stellar, but they are well-suited to their roles. Dakota Johnson portrays just the right balance of detachment and confusion required for her character. Her reluctance to embrace heroism is palpable and serves as a driving force throughout the movie. The rest of the cast also meet the expectations for their respective roles.Numerous aspects of Madame Web require refinement and clarification but it's notable that the runtime isn't adversely affected. Surprisingly, the two-hour duration passes smoothly without feeling prolonged or dragged out.Madame Web would benefit from better writing but overall it's a simple and decent movie that knows what it is and doesn't try to go beyond that.5.5/10."
jared-25331,1,WORST THEATRICAL RELEASED SUPERHERO & COMIC BOOK MOVIE EVER!!!!!,"This movie was doomed after the atrocious trailer & I've been waiting to watch this movie, just so that I can move on with my life. And after watching the movie, I can safely agree with everyone who says that this is the worst theatrical released Superhero and Comic Book Movie ever made & I'm only saying this because I watched Spider-Man: Lotus last year & that movie was even worse than this movie, but that doesn't make it any better.Everything about the filmmaking in this movie is some of the worst that I've ever seen in my life & I've seen Jeepers Creepers: Reborn (2022). The camerawork is absolutely amateurish & the edit is abysmal, where they constantly use zooms at random point throughout the runtime. The acting is atrocious from everyone, which hurts because this movie has a lot of great actors including Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott, Emma Roberts, Celeste O'Connor, Isabela Merced, & Sydney Sweeney. Then again, it doesn't help that their dialogue is among some of the worst put onto screen, especially given the fact that the two writers of this movie are the same writers of Morbius (2022). The villain of this movie, played by Tahar Rahim who looks like Jeremy Jahns from YouTube, is the worst villain in any Superhero & Comic Book Movie or TV Show that I've ever seen. With all that being said I'm going to be spoiling major plot points in this movie from this point on in my review.SPOILER WARNING: To anyone who saw the marketing for this movie, that scene with all the Spider-Woman kicking Ezekiel Sims' butt, yeah that scene last for about 50 seconds & it's all takes place in a premonition that happens within first 19 minutes of this movie. This movie takes place in 2003, so this movie is basically set within the same timeline as Tom Holland's Spider-Man from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but Sony chose to cut out any & all references to Spider-Man & Peter Parker from this movie.In conclusion, Madame Web (2024) is one of the most cynical & abysmal movies that I've ever seen in my life. I feel terrible for a lot of these actors, because I like a lot of them, especially Sydney Sweeney, none of them deserve to have this movie in their filmography. Sony should be ashamed of themselves for making this movie & at this point Kevin Fiege & Marvel Studios need to take the Spider-Man rights away from Sony, because they clearly can't handle having Spider-Man or any other Superhero if we're being honest with ourselves."
stevencayer,1,Oof,"Oh man. When the trailer for MADAME WEB came out, I thought it looked bad. I admit, my opinion was biased because of Sony's quite abysmal track record of making Spider-Man spinoff movies without Spider-Man in them. Well, I hate being right, this time. This is about Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson), a New York City paramedic who gains the unpredictable power of immediate visions of the future after a near death experience. She is then forced to protect 3 girls from being killed by a mysterious adversary. That's the boilerplate description. This movie is unacceptable. Pretty much everything involved with this movie is bad. The villain's motivation is he keeps having the same dream of him being killed by these 3 girls dressed up in Spider-Girl costumes, so he obviously needs to find and murder them before that happens, right? My question is, why did they kill you, huh? Also, it seemed like they filmed his lines later, because his mouth didn't really sync with the dialogue. Oh speaking of the dialogue, the writing is atrocious! These guys are responsible for writing some of the worst movies out there. I don't know how they still have jobs. It was like every actor knew this was crap, so they didn't even try. There are some easter eggs in here tying this to Spider-Man, but I didn't even know about them until doing my research afterwards. I guess I was so bored some details got glazed over. The effects are bad, even the ""action-packed"" third act was unsatisfying. The only reason I'm not giving this a 0 is because of Adam Scott, who plays Webb's partner, Ben Parker. I can't believe they canned the Bat-Girl movie and not this one. Sony needs to stop making these mediocre live-action Spider-verse movies. They keep trying to set up this whole universe, and they're failing every time so far. I'm genuinely curious what VENOM 3 is going to be. I also can't believe this is the same company that made the animated Spider-verse movies, which are some of my favorite movies. MADAME WEB is the stupidest version of TERMINATOR you can think of. I recommend seeing this, only if you're a masochist and want to see how far rock bottom really is. This review is shamelessly brought to you by Pepsi. When you need money to make a trash movie, Pepsi is there for you."
DoNotComeToTheCinemaDepressed,1,"🤦🏻 Good Grief. Dakota Johnson, you needed to Go FULL HIGH EVOLUTIONARY. WATCH THE TAPES OF HIGH EVOLUTIONARY⚡ IN GUARDIANS 3. Implement them into your Next Performance.","Of Just How Bad this thing really was.Just Got out of a 4DX Screening of Madame Web.Even 4DX couldn't save this Thing.The SSU Needs to Really Come Up with Something After This.""You know the best thing about the Future? It hasn't Happened yet"". In real Life Human Terms, this Quote it completely Pointless and Doesn't make sense. In the Context of the Superhero Madame Web and Her Powers, whether a good or bad event is about to happen, the quote sort of works (for the bad events Because she can avert them) and then is completely stupid for the good Events 🤦🏻🚆 And What's Up with the Train Station Scene? Rahim is Hunting Down the 3 Girls to Kill Them, sees the 3 Girls with Madame Web and then Kills the Cops? Instead of Attacking the 3 Girls? Who Wrote this Stuff?And what about the Truck Crashing the Ambulance Scene? 🚑 If you look at where the truck was Heading to, the Truck was Heading Full speed into the water before the Ambulance Crash? 🤔😮🤦🏻Is this Film even Real?On to the Film -The Concept Was Good, but instead of just Replaying them, how about Giving us 3 Scenarios each Time an Event Happens or the Villain Attacks and Failing at 2 of them but Succeeding in the 3rd? You know, like the Diner Scene? It would of been far more entertaining.There's so many Problems with this Film and I See What they were Going For but here's the 5 Main Problems(and there's tons more but here's 5)1. 🙋 The PerformancesDakota Johnson, Good Lord, she was just Sleep Walking through the Thing. SHE NEEDED TO GO FULL HIGH EVOLUTIONARY! (TOP 5 MCU VILLAIN WHAT A PERFORMANCE!⚡). Dakota, just go Full Force.Tahar Rahim, not good enough, boring as hell.Sydney Sweeney, for her character type, a young shy type, it was ok.Celeste O'Connor, she was good, she at least was animated and tried to liven up the place.Isabela Merced, she was ok.2. 📜 You've already shot yourself in the foot when you constantly make the worst decisions at every Turn within the script. Again, just give us 3 Scenarios with the Concept every time an event happens, not just constantly replaying them, it's too boring.3. 📜 And then we have the dialogue, some of which is horrendous, and you couple that with anywhere from lackluster to ok at best performances and the results are a very lackluster watch (again, Celeste O'Connor at least tried something).4. 🎬 Then we have the Direction of this whole thing, the Director couldn't execute this thing effectively(Mainly because the Script was Just making Terrible Decisions at every Turn), but the Direction was completely Lackluster at Nearly every single Facet.5. 🎬 The Edits, the edits were sometimes horrendous, cutting every millisecond(Particularly the End Fight). When you cut like that, you can't follow what the hell is going on.1 Positive -👍 There were a few Scenes where the 4 Women seemed to be clicking whether they were arguing or cooperating, the synergy seemed to be there.Overall, because of the 5 main problems and the absolute brain dead writing, this was a lackluster and completely missed opportunity for a Very entertaining film(in a good way entertaining, not this embarrassment of entertainment)."
DanLawson146,7,I enjoyed it. Sue me,"POSITIVES:1) I thought the chemistry between Cassie and the girls was really well done. I really bought into Cassie's older sister sort of dynamic with the girls. I also thought her chemistry with Ben was well done too
2) The film is short and goes along at a good pace. I have watched plenty of films recently where I've felt the pacing was too slow and that scenes could've been cut out, but here I never felt like the film was dragging
3) Look, I'm not saying it should win any Oscars, but I enjoyed myself while I was watching it and I found it to be a very likeable film with very likeable leading ladies; it charmed me in a way that a lot of films don'tNEGATIVES:1) There's no getting away from the fact that the film is badly made from a technical perspective. The direction and cinematography are both pretty woeful and it feels almost like a student film at times
2) I can't believe they actually released this film without anybody fixing how terribly out of sync the dialogue is with character's mouth movements at several points. The scenes with the main villain in his apartment were especially terrible for this
3) The script could've definitely done with another draft or several. Some of the dialogue is really cringey and the amount of plot contrivances are insane (facial recognition on the girls based on a sketch from a dream that shows what they look like in the future???). Also, Cassie's random detour to the Amazon for all of about 10 minutes felt so out of place and unnecessary."
Fields201,1,The Worst,"My nephew and I went to see a bad film on Valentines Day to encapsulate our love life. My nephew said his spider senses were tingling once we arrived at the theater telling him this movie will be worse than we thought.He was right.This is incompetence at another level. The acting is incompetent, filming is incompetent, and even the villain was incompetent. He sprouts off dialogue that not even a real life villain would say. Hes not even threat since everything hits him as the girls run from him. The same thing even happens twice where he terrorizes the girls and the main chick hits him with the car.Everyone is insufferable and nobody is likeable. Like the main chick leaves the girls in the woods for hours and does pretty much nothing as night falls and they are still stuck in the woods wondering if the person they never got to know will come back for them. When she does, she tells at them for leaving the woods.I only like the character of Ben who apparently is Ben Parker, Spidermans dad. Other than that, everything else is abysmal. No wonder Hollywood is failing. Avoid."
patricklsheridan,10,A perfect terrible film,"It is rare that a film is so awful that it goes along the Möbius strip long enough to transform into a piece of pure brilliance. I can't exactly articulate how Clarkson pulled this off, but all I can do is recommend this film emphatically.Every shot is interesting, there is no commitment to the standard shot-reverse-shot format, instead every scene will make you feel disoriented. The lighting, random zoom ins and zoom outs, the random quick cuts, everything is so janky and bizarre.The acting is so bad that every scene with the main characters transforms into comedy gold, the delivery and timing of some lines are incredible. Sweeney and Rahim are especially terrible, which is shocking because they are both great in their previous work. The only explanation for this (the fact that every single actor gives the worst performance of their careers) has to be the script and direction. It is like when you take an exam (the average should be a 50/100 if you were guessing randomly) but every scene, every line, every delivery, is a solid 0/100. It is like there was a concerted effort to make the worst film possible, and it is amazing.And the CG resembles bad AI generated trash.This movie is like watching a car crash in slow motion. 10/10 will see again and I recommend that you go as well. It is endlessly entertaining, like nothing I have seen before."
enrique131,6,Is not such a bad movie,"People are very cruel. I enjoyed the movie, i thought the idea was ok, acting was not terrific but was not awful or disappointed. Is a Marvel movie? Yes, because it says so at the beginning. Is it fair to compare with other marvel's movies? No, not at all. If i have to guess why it didn't work i would say it was because of the expectations people had beforehand.If you watch it just thinking about watching a movie a bit different and with no other expectations i think you might enjoy it. Basically is the movie about a woman (Dakota) who is capable of seen the future and tries to help 3 woman from being killed by someone who is after them."
panterm-28679,3,Longest Pepsi Ad ever made,"Went into this film blind. I'm not a marvel fan, so didn't know what to expect.In short, the best scenes of the movie are in the trailer.The action is sparse, dialog is drawn out, and the manner in which it is shot leaves a lot to be desired.There seemed to be CGI where CGI wasn't needed. With a lot of scenes very obviously shot on green screen.Every scene featuring Ezekiel in his home/lair took you out of the movie. Most of his dialog feels dubbed despite you being able to see his face and lips. The latter of which fail to match the tone and flow of his speech.The run time was too long for a movie with so little actual story. I found myself checking my watch at the 1hr 30 point, desperately hoping for an end.The Pepsi product placement is so heavy throughout. I couldn't help but leave the cinema thinking did I just watch the world's longest Pepsi advert? Because an entertaining movie I did not."
belxo,5,Not superhero movie; thriller prequel,"If you know what the movie is really before watching, you might like it better. When we have high expectations/think it's one type of genre and it ends up being more of an entirely different one, we def end up more disappointed. This is not a marvel type of action/funny superhero movie. This is more like an origin story or a prequel to hopefully something better, and is more of a thriller.. with little action. Also, don't expect a show of powers either, not from the 3 ladies that our main character is helping. They don't even have their powers in this nor do we see them get their powers.. only glimpse we have of their powers is in a future premonition. And main character barely shows/uses hers because she's still figuring out she even has them, etc. Hence the origin/prequel comment."
fissorevincent,1,"Jared, all is forgiven","This... thing, if it can be called anything else, successfully turns Morbius into a coherent, fun, albeit structurally flawed and a tad too campy B-list movie. THIS is how bad this movie is.Where can I start? The script is massively convoluted and nonsensical, the acting (apart from Schwartz as Ben Parker and Yazpik as the Peruvian shaman) is below remedial level (massive boos to. Rahim, who seems to be absolutely willing to turn his massively overdue American opportunity into a collection of putrid performances for cheap cheques, and is not helped by a performance that is assuredly phoned in for three quarters of the time), the special effects are appalling (pretty sure the effects houses are not to blame, especially if Sony decided to butcher this movie in reshoots), the product placements are overt and, to top off this pyramid of crap, it does not even fulfil its contract towards the overarching Sony Spider-Man Universe, since, apart from the shoehorned Parker family (seemingly that of the Tom Holland era), there are no real connects being made to the other movies of the universe, and the absence of mid/post-credit sequence is not helping things for viewers to try and place this movie."
pedroquintaoo,3,Will become a classic of bad movies,"While watching ""Madame Web,"" I had a surprisingly comical experience due to poorly written scenes and performances that felt more fitting for a ""Scary Movie."" The film turned out to be a quirky mix of mediocrity and hilarity, potentially earning a status as a classic among bad superhero movies, comparable to ""Catwoman"" or ""Batman & Robin."" This unique blend makes it a guilty pleasure for some viewers.The highlight for me was the end, with the captivating song ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries during the closing credits, providing an enjoyable musical moment. However, inevitable criticisms arise regarding the plot, with unnecessary scenes and questionable narrative decisions, such as the ease with which the protagonist travels to Peru while being sought by the police, or abandoning rescued teens in the woods to delve into her mother's past, harming the story's cohesion.The lack of engagement with the storyline was noticeable, suggesting a simpler plot could have avoided forced situations and confusing ideas. The attempt to recreate the atmosphere of 2003 fell short, with modern elements clearly visible in various scenes. The absence of the promoted superheroines was disappointing, as they only briefly appeared as a villain's dream and a vision of Cassandra Web at the end.The performances, including Dakota Johnson's and the young cast's, were horrible, they all look lost. In summary, ""Madame Web"" left me disappointed due to its lack of innovation, failing to let the protagonist shine as a superhero and giving the impression of watching a lengthy trailer for future ""Spiders-Women"" films."
blgerrardsw,2,Stick to Animation SONY!,"My anticipation for Madame Web's cinematic release was already low, considering the lackluster trailers, TV spots, and early reviews - a trend we've sadly grown accustomed to with SONY's Marvel ventures like Morbius, Venom 1 & 2, and even the Amazing Spider-Man series. Yet, my disappointment with Madame Web surpassed expectations. The entire film felt devoid of life and intrigue. The performances seemed lackluster, with Dakota Johnson notably disengaged.The movie's villain lacked depth, perhaps the most uninspired Marvel antagonist to date, adorned in a forgettable costume. Costumes overall appeared cheap and uninspired. The editing felt disjointed, with incessant cuts and distracting special effects.The film's saving grace lies in its concept - the exploration of precognition and mentorship, particularly intriguing in the context of caring for three young women. However, the execution falls flat, opting for a mundane approach.In summary, Madame Web is not worth the investment of time or money. For those still curious, waiting for its streaming release would be a more prudent choice."
chomerly,1,From start to finish this movie is awful.,"If ever there was a movie to avoid then this is up there with some of the most horribly written movies to have ever existed.The plot starts out with Cassandra Webb's mother, heavily pregnant in the Peruvian jungle, looking for a ""special"" type of spider that is said to give human beings fantastic abilities. Her motivations however is to use the spider as a means to create various types of medicines and vaccines in a hope to cure the sick, though it is really about her unborn daughter (soon to be Dakota Johnson later in the movie) that has some kind of life threatening disease. The other person in the mix is predictably the bad guy and his motivations are seemingly more sinister, though he never feels like a villainous threat to society or the world at large.As the movie progresses you slowly come to the realisation that you couldn't care less about any of the characters. There is the most weakest of back stories for each, some of them told in less the a few minutes, and none of what are told seems to matter. In fact, I can summarise the opening plot here right now.Pregnant scientist looks for a special type of spider in the Peruvian jungle with someone who is obviously villain. Scientist returns to the expedition camp, telling everyone
that she has found the spider and a small skirmish erupts resulting in the pregnant scientist's death at the hands of the villain. Spider people (they can't be called spiderman for obvious reasons) help pregnant scientist who is left dying on the floor of the camp by putting her in a pool, in a cave, with no explanation why, before she is purposely bitten by a spider like the one she found. Said spider's venom miraculously cures the child, who is born there and then in the pool while the mother dies.If it sounds overly simplistic then that is because it is. Literally the whole beginning of the movie starts out as summarised and each time the ""story"" advances it gets worse and worse. There are no redeemable qualities to this movie at all. The writing is bad, the script is bad, the acting is poor and the overall execution is comical at best. Every time I think of this movie all I can hear is the Principal for the Movie Billy Madison, berating the idiotic answer given after being asked a question from the school quiz. (If you know, you know).Overall I will say that this movie will go down as one of the worst in history. Marvel fans, and especially the hard-core fans of some the actresses will be going through all the movie review sites to artificially inflate the score but believe me, Morbius was a poor movie and Madame Webb makes that look like a masterpiece.Avoid this movie and pretend it never existed."
jmbwithcats,7,Much Better Than the IMDB Score,"Madam Web is Final Destination meets Spider-Man.Everyone hates Madam Web, Dakota Johnson dropped her talent agency after the first trailer came out, she says she hasn't even seen the finished movie... how can everyone hate a movie they haven't even seen?Madam Web has a 3.8 on IMDb, and I think it's largely by those who have not even seen the film, I think maybe there's a systemic misogynistic conspiracy against women-driven movies, because there's no way this movie was a 3.8, it's actually pretty good. I give the movie a 7.I'm going to be the first to say it. I want a Madam Web sequel.Don't listen to the haters."
LucyKempers,1,Dreadful,"As bad as everyone is saying, what is more shocking is the 1200 (at the time of this rewiew) 10 star ratings....Friends and family strike again LOL.Absolute disaster of a film and the director has no talent whatsoever unfortunately. I don't know why hollywood keeps hiring these people. The character design, the story, the shots, every single thing about this movie is dreadful. Let's all hope that the feedback is received and a) this director doesn't get hired any time soon for another movie and b) people with actual talent are hired to make movies. It's really, really, terrible. Avoid watching in my opinion."
glori1491,8,It's a shame about the bad reviews,"This film tells us the origin of Madame Web or Cassie Web, it tells us the story of how her mother investigated spiders that have the key to the cure of diseases (later we realize that the mother decided to travel to look for a cure for Cassie's illness), she ends up being killed by the villain Ezekiel from the movie (who wanted to use the spider's powers to his advantage), we are shown how Cassie was saved by an indigenous tribe from Peru (spiders) and how she later returns to Peru to look for answers and there they tell us more about their powers. Cassie is a paramedic, who begins to see the future, in one of her visions she saves 3 teenagers (who in the future will be Spider Girl-Spider Woman), they teach us how they establish bonds of friendship and family and how in the process Cassie discovers who she is, in the end she is paraplegic and blind but as she says for the first time she is sure of who she is, as secondary characters we have Ben Parker and Mary Parker (pregnant with Peter), reminding us that they are part of Spiderman's world. I really liked this movie, of the last ones I've seen about superheroes it has been one of the best, I didn't fall asleep at any point, it kept me entertained, I would like to know more about what is going to happen in the future of Madame Web, like the teenagers They are going to manage to obtain their powers under the tutelage of Madame Web, it is a shame that the film has not hit, and that it does poorly at the box office and in critics, I think it is not the typical superhero movie of destruction, of villains with superpowers , and a superheroine with powers more emphatically from the mind than from the outside, which may not catch the public's attention. I also feel that whenever the film is directed by a female director or a female protagonist the criticism is stronger. I want to know and read more about Madame Web, it's a shame that we won't see more about this franchise. If I accept that Dakota is not the best actress, I thought the teenage girls were good, not the typical dumb teenagers. I really don't understand the bad reviews that it is a disaster of a movie, of dialogue, what a bad ending, in my case I saw a different movie."
jindann,6,Wasnt so bad actually,"The beginning was kind of ok, but lacks the actions and intensity for a hero flick. The story werent that awful really, but it follows the hero flick formula which was about the same over and over, has lots of potential if it's more polished and needs a lot more of twists and intensity. Actions werent nearly enough and badly choreographed, kind of stiff like students making youtubes. The acting was average, dokota was the only one that carried through but werent so great, I dont blame the supporting girls as they were obviously new and inexperienced. The scenes setups were actually rather nice and convincing, but the cgi wasnt at the quality of big productions. The movie tried to explain the origin of the spider powers and bring new characters to the spider verse, but the ending was quite a let down that wasnt at all satisfying, but certainly I enjoyed this movie a lot more than the boring oscar garbages like oppenheimer and poor things, and this is honestly better than suicide squad and ms marvel and received a lower rating (coz its rigged)."
daisukereds,3,"""How would you know you can climb a wall if you've never tried?""","A baby-sitting movie in a Superhero setting, where the lead can see the future and has to prevent NOT-Spiderman from killing teenagers (because he has dreams/visions about them). The girls run and hide around a lot, some BS happens and then the movie ends.The foundation of the script is heavily written around a hollow core of ""parents and children"". The cinematography is actually good, and at least ""teaches"" how to do CPR. It also does away with showing premonitions every time something is to be changed near the end.. respecting the viewers intelligence in at least that aspect! And it's easy to follow (if you don't fall asleep) with how simplistic it is.Aside from that, it is barely anything else..
The movie itself isn't terrible.. it's just beyond bland and boring. Also, calling this a Superhero movie is really disingenuous and a marketing ploy to get people to see it. Stay home! There are no good action sequences and nobody is written memorably....
Venom making money was a mistake. Sony has half a franchise, and they can't get anyone talented enough to do something with it. And what they continue to release seems like high-budgeted fan fiction!"
MrDHWong,3,Continues Sony's complete lack of creativity in carving out their own superhero cinematic universe,"""Madame Web"" is a superhero film based on the Marvel comic book character of the same name. Directed by S. J. Clarkson and starring Dakota Johnson in the title role, it continues Sony's complete lack of creativity in carving out their own superhero cinematic universe in another dull, forgettable origin story.In 2003 in New York City, Cassandra ""Cassie"" Webb (Dakota Johnson) works as a paramedic saving lives and driving patients to the hospital in an ambulance. One day, Cassie finds herself involved in an accident which causes her to develop psychic abilities that allow her to see into the future. With her new clairvoyant powers, Cassie learns that three young women; Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced) are now being hunted by the dangerous Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) and vows to protect them from him at all costs. While the quartet are on the run, Cassie soon realises she must confront her own troubled past in order to ensure that the three women don't fall victim to Ezekiel's influence.It's pretty clear at this point that Sony have no clue what direction they are heading in with their superhero IPs. Not only is their shared timeline with Disney's Marvel Cinematic Universe a convoluted mess, but it also seems that they are unsure how to handle the characters inhabiting the very universe they created themselves. The public's reception of these films appears to reflect this as next to no one can be bothered investing their time in something they have little interest in watching in the first place. Following suit from the failure of ""Morbius"" two years earlier, ""Madame Web"" attempts to introduce more characters into Sony's pitiful ""Spider-Man"" Universe but like last time it is dead on arrival.From the way this film started, I could already tell it just wasn't going to work. Here, we see a pregnant scientist in 1973 searching the jungles of Peru for a rare spider that is supposed to have mysterious properties in its venom. It should be noted that this information is not conveyed to us here through what the characters are experiencing but rather through awkwardly worded exposition that feels like it was added to the script at the last minute. Immediately after, the scientist announces she has discovered the spider and is soon shot and left for dead by one of her fellow explorers. Flashing forward thirty years, the film then shows our protagonist Cassie rushing to the scene of an accident without any real context of what happened within those three decades, instead choosing to shelve this important plot element for much later on in the story. The jumbled, poorly edited way the film tries to set up its plot within a short time frame makes it hard to care about anything else that happens afterwards because if a solid storytelling foundation cannot be done in just the first 10 minutes then it's clearly going to be all downhill from here on out.To make matter worse, the action scenes, if you can call them that, are never exciting. There were only about two scenes throughout the entire movie that could be considered ""action packed"" in the loosest sense and even then there wasn't any enjoyment to be had from any of them. In one, we see Cassie trying to defend the three girls from the advancing Ezekiel on a subway train, only for the scene to end almost as quickly as it started. I couldn't help but feel cheated after this sequence concluded, as it gave the impression it was going to be an intense demonstration of skills between hero and villain. But instead, the scene simply moves onto the next one as though we are supposed to forget about everything that just happened. Because of this, the film's general lack of excitement makes it quite boring to watch most of the time, especially considering some of the weak dialogue the characters are made to speak.Though not quite as bad as in ""Morbius"", the film's visuals and editing definitely leave a lot to be desired. What is supposed to be the film's way of showing Cassie using her powers is seen through a series of quick-cut shots of something bad taking place clumsily inter-spliced with repetitive seizure-inducing flashes. At first I didn't mind this creative technique, but as the movie continued on it really became irritating to watch each time Cassie showed her signature abilities. This is problematic since it is the backbone for her entire character's superhero gimmick, and when that starts to wear you down, you know your film is not working the way you had intended. What I would have done instead is focus on the very thing Cassie is looking into the future for an indeterminate amount of time before cutting back to the present, as the constant flashes are an unnecessary addition to this visual style.In the role of Cassie, Dakota Johnson looks like she's trying her best with the awful material she has to work with, even if it was probably all for nothing. It can't be easy making such a bland character seem somewhat likeable, but Johnson puts on a brave face and powers through the mediocrity of the film's script. There's not a lot of depth to Cassie as a character, other than that she is socially awkward and has a caring nature. One thing I was relieved to see is that Cassie is not depicted as a man-hating ""girlboss"", as has been the trend in many female-led films released in the past few years. For the most part she appreciates all the male help she receives, especially from her co-worker Ben (Adam Scott), which is one of the reasons her character is a bit more endearing to the audience.On the other hand, I found myself struggling to remember anything remotely substantial about the three other women in the cast beyond what is seen on the surface. Sydney Sweeney's Julia is an introverted nerd who wears thick rimmed glasses and has difficulty interacting with others, Celeste O'Connor's Mattie is a short tempered skeptic who flips people off when they get in her way, and Isabela Merced's Anya does little more than act like a third wheel among this trio. Without doing any extensive internet research on these characters, this was all that came to my mind when thinking carefully about them. Given their supposed importance to the story, this is pretty sad when you think about it.In addition to their poor development, it would seem that these three each aren't very bright either. One scene where this is evident to audience shows the trio hiding out in a diner where they are told by Cassie to keep a low profile. A short time later, the three of them walk over to a group of high school boys where they proceed to climb onto the table and dance to ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears, alerting Ezekiel to their presence. It's hard for me to like characters who do such brazenly stupid things like this for no other reason than for a cheap attempt at comedy.However, where the film really falters in terms of character development is in its villain Ezekiel, and Tahar Rahim does little to add anything noteworthy to his performance. At no point did Ezekiel feel like a genuine threat since there's nothing interesting about him as a character. It is established that Ezekiel has the same powers as Cassie but they only ever seem to work whenever the plot demands it. What could have been an interesting adversary for Cassie is instead a one dimensional bad guy who wants the three girls dead because he had a brief vision they were going to kill him. This leaves many unanswered questions regarding his purpose in the story. Why do these specific girls play a part in him dying? Why is he so easily avoided despite his pursuits taking place in broad daylight? Why doesn't he see some kind personal connection to Cassie as they share the same abilities? Being a rich as he is, why couldn't he just hire someone else to deal with the girls instead of doing it himself? When the movie leaves you in the dark this much about a villain and his motives, you tend to lose interest in wanting to see what happens to him in the end.With such a poor track record so far, Sony doesn't seem to be learning any lessons regarding the state of their own Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like ""Morbius"" before it, ""Madame Web"" is simply a bad product, not bad as in the cheesy fun kind, but rather
a forgettably boring type of bad, which is debatably worse. Previously, I said that the poor reception of ""Morbius"" should serve as a wakeup call for the company, although judging by the quality of this film, it would appear that yearning has fallen on deaf ears. I wish plenty of good luck to all future additions to this cinematic universe, because they are definitely going to need it.I rate it 3/10."
jaxbobsan,1,Disgraceful,Let me start off by saying this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Congratulations to the cast and crew for not knowing how to put a movie together. How do you take a fairly uninteresting character and make them even less interesting? Disgraceful. This movie is an example of how not to make a movie. First off there are so many subplots that the writers seem to forget about. Not to mention the poorly delivered dialogue from Johnson and the rest of the cast (Minus Adam Scott he was great.) This movie is a trashy amalgamation of several boring and uninspired ideas. This is not a superhero movie. This is an experimental film trying to relate in some way to superheroes but ultimately fails to. Madame Web is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you go to see it in theaters I recommend going with a friend so you can laugh at the outrageously stupid dialogue and F tier acting. I can't in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.
sthomp15,1,How dare they do this to Stan Lee's legacy,"I can completely understand bringing in madame web to bring together the spider verse and the MCU multiverse, which would have been really cool. I know nerds like me and some comic book geeks really digged Secret Wars and the other groovy things Madame Web brought with her.I was hopeful during the very rushed first 15 minutes of the movie, But this... No one asked for this. No one wanted this. And they gave this to us anyway and people who aren't even privy to the story tried to have faith in it.I even accepted Morbius, and thought Venom 1 and 2 was okay... But this... I even tried to root for the actresses and I had to acknowledge that their poor acting was not just the writing.The editing is bad, the cinematography is bad, the actresses were bad, the writers are bad. Adam Scott playing a young Ben Parker ( the prolific Uncle Ben who actually is supposed to be ex-military, but we can overlook that for the sake of the MCU and the multiverse) was the only decent aspect of the movie because you believed he was an actual person.This movie could have been so good, like really good. A movie and possibly a sequel based on this really gnarly entity that could bring the entire spider verse and the MCU together, just wasted away. But as a standalone movie, garbage and an embarrassment.I didn't think I would side with the other reviews and I can actually like bad movies, but this... Someone spit on Stan Lee's grave with this one..."
JohnDSolis,1,this are 116 minutes no one is going to give me back,"This can be the worst movie, even listening to Bad Bunny could be given a change. Bad dialog, bad editing, horrible bad character.Honestly, it looks like a kids project movie, done with TikTok videos.There is no positive on this one, it is not a movie for people that like cinema, the ending is soooo bad, that cut in the movie could have been a better choice.I have nothing else to say, just please save money, get an ice cream.Spoilers:
The antagonist it is really lame, in this movie, only women are intelligent and protagonist, all men are secondary, you cannot tell if the bad guy is a copy of Spider-Man or batman, and or if the protagonist is thinking she is Doc Xavier."
gali-84813,1,Worst Movie Ever watched,"This is literally the worst movie ever forget about the cringe, bad, goofy writing of MsheU (Marvel). The writing in this one is next lvl bad. I think sony now wants to take the throne from Marvel of making huge disappointments and bad movies.It shouldn't have made in first place, what's even the point making this if it's not even connected to any other sony character venom or spiderman. This is too much milking of spiderman universe this was just the start they are not holding back coming out with bigger gung kraven the hunter wait what this character doesn't even have a single page in comics."
RomanceNovelist,7,"""Bad movie"" thing greatly exaggerated.","A woman gets into an accident and becomes psychic, unlocking dormant powers given to her at birth. I like Dakota Johnson. I think shes charming, smart, feminine, but also strong as a heroine/actress in her movies roles. The young people her character was supposed to protect... meh. Theyre the same as all zoomers in movies today... stilted dialogue that is neither hip and tries oh so hard to quip and act tough. Hollywwood does not know how to make zoomers likeable and that's the problem with why their movies aren't selling. They write these zoomer characters as if they are basing them off of social media personalities like X or Ticktock. They seem unrelatable.The reviews completely tanked the movie so when I watched on NF I went in with my expectations set to low. Surprisingly, the reviews claiming this was the worse movie ever were greatly exaggerated and it just goes to show how people are easily influenced by what other people are saying. Was it Shakespearean? No. Was it the worst ever? No. The plot wasn't overly bad. A tad cliché as a comic book action movie but not worse than something like Electra or Wonder Woman 1984. I think this is a case of, the public needs to start thinking for themselves before they decide that something is awful. I did not love it but I did not hate it either. Monkey see monkey do. It's okay to not like it, but always judge something for yourselves first."
Critical-Thoughts954,1,Sony no!!! Just stop and take a breath of intelligence,"Worst superhero film. The acting if that what you can call it is showing no chemistry whatsoever between the four leads, the audio dubbing for the villain actually took me out of the film for how distracting it was. The action is just nothing the final battle is just laughably bad and stupid spoiler alert it involves a coke sign and firework as well the 3 girls are actually in their suits for only four minutes and it's pretty lame. Story can be good but it was just handled so poorly, I couldn't even comprehend it especially during the diner scene trust me. Sony stop just stop at this point sad..."
gramercyk35,8,I do not understand the hate.,"I honestly don't get the hate on this movie. It's not a superhero movie. It's about 4 people before they become the heroes they're destined to be. I wouldn't even call it an origin story for anyone other than Webb. This is basically the spider-verse version of Pennyworth except not as boring. This goes into the how's and why's that the spider people exist and lays out the mythos at the base of the spider-verse. And for those saying it's not canon... Marvel, Disney, and Sony say it is, soooo it is canon whether or not you like it. So basically this is a really good movie that isn't meant to be a superhero movie. Does it have some issues yes but there's no such thing as a perfect movie. Honestly the only thing that ticked me off was them walking away from the campfire without putting it out."
SnoopyStyle,6,not the worst,"It's 2003. Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott) are NYFD paramedics. She's an orphan when 30 years earlier, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) killed her mother during an Amazon scientific expedition. They had gone to find a mysterious spider with great healing powers and a local legend of a people with outrageous superpowers. Back to 2003, Sims has not aged. He has spider superpowers and premonition of his own death years later. Using stolen tech, he finds the teenage versions of his three spider-powered assassins; Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazón (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor).The popular criticism is that this is the worst movie of the year. Everybody is dunking on this and my expectations are pretty low coming into this. It's not the worst thing in the world. It's not even the worst thing coming from this branch of the spider team. It's passable with some big issues in writing, logic, and overall flow. Most importantly, I like Dakota Johnson. She's playing the reluctant hero. Now, the three girls are rather annoying at first. The movie solves this by showing the villain right away. I thought the girls would spend half the movie thinking that Webb had actually kidnapped them. That would truly be annoying. I get the standard bratty teen characters, but I don't have to like them. I would make a few changes. First, I would skip the 1973 opening. The audience could discover the story along with Cassandra and there could always be flashbacks. Second, the girls should join her on the trip to the Amazon. That would make more logical sense. She would want the girls close to her at all times and the final battle could take place in the jungle. That's also a great way for the girls to get their superpowers. This movie has plenty of writing problems and others, but I've seen much worst."
Dupps,5,not good but not as bad as the critics say,"When watching Madame Web, I thought it would be as bad as She Hulk. It isn't. It's in fact not a dump.The first 40 minutes is quite good. Then it starts to have some illogical and incoherent scenes, like the girls following madame web out of the train without knowing her (like who would do that? Lol). Meh, it stills passable.But then the girls dancing on the table for the guys... girls don't do that in the real world, not in a restaurant with 7 customers in the deep wood when someone wants to kill you. That was for me the worst scene.Still, globally the movie is quite coherent, just nothing original. For me it was a little bit better than Morbius. I really wonder why people hate this movie so much. Is this a trend? Or an apprehension everyone wanted to believe..."
edie_22032024,,an unassuming Marvel franchise,"I had watched this film quite a while ago as one of those films through which I tried to make a testament to my memory, say, if I later still recall something from a film it should be turned out to be a better one. And this film is one of that. For the better part.I found it irony as someone don't like marvel films, it turns out I definitely don't dislike this film that made so many marvel fans mad about it instead.Checked out the production box office fate earlier before I write a few words just now, it is also rather handsome a turnover that made from a relatively high budget naturally if allotted to films that non marvel at all. Which means, people do bite it at the meantime complain about it, it was an unusual negative spiderman character that evoked the ire towards the film, which I for one really could not care less.The film is pacing decently, Dakota Johnson is just that Dakota Johnson if you like her, you just like, if you don't you probably think twice, she definitely has a unique poised style to define déjà vu effortlessly.I give it 6.6/10."
jimmycondon,2,Worse then morbius,"This movie reminds me of the time I saw Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey. This movie literally has a feel of nothingness to it. Like, what was the reason why they made this, idk. Madame web is one of the worst movies of the whole dam decade. All of the performances are bad and most of the characters you knew going into this movie like uncle Ben or the spider girls are barely in the movie. This isn't even a movie where it's so bad it's good, it's just plain awful. I honestly think I'm being nice to this movie by giving it two stars only because the actresses in this movie are hot. Overall though, don't watch this movie, go see Bob Marley instead."
namob-43673,3,"Not a bad idea, but messy with horrible dialogue","This movie rank among absolute garbage like Justice League, Love & Thunder, and Superman III. The script, directing, and everything cinematic in this movie is about as good as a 2nd grade production of King Lear, if it was shot on a cellphone... in the dark.What make me a bit angry is that the idea is not bad, and since the actors are okay this could have been pretty okay. But looking at the bio of the director, writers and pretty much everyone involved in this disaster, then the mess of a film is partly explained - not a single good job among them. The only ones decently holding up are the actors. We know Dakota can act, and some of the others are not horrible either, but no one, not a ton of A-list stars could have even started to make this into something coherent and watchable.The only thing that make sense is if someone deliberately wanted to make the worst superhero movie of all time, hired a lousy director and the worst writers team in living memory to accomplish this feat, and they almost pulled it off.A very generous 3/10 because the acting and idea is good, but this is awful with atrocious dialogue."
nour_xp3000,2,Pepsi defeats evil,Very boring superhero movie to the extent that I was the only one at the theater. I had to watch the rating first. Very weak directing and scene cuts. Story is made of poor puzzle pieces that are not fitting together at all. A super hero movie withour super heros. Maybe she is not a super hero because of drinking pepsi instead of alcohol? Is madam web should be professor charles xavier? I dont know.Where have the clan in peru gone? What happened to her mother? Is she having future visions or repeating the present to fix things up? Why is she so pro in driving vehicles to hit hime more than once .. what have i watched??
ryon11,2,Who Signed Off On This?,This abomination makes Mortal Kombat: Annihilation look like Citizen Kane. Literally the first three minutes of the movie let you know how bad it is and what you are getting yourself into. I don't know who edited this movie but they either drink five gallons of coffee per day or have a massive cocaine problem because the cuts and edits are insane. But it isn't as though the edits take away from the story as there really isn't one which is ok because there also isn't a whole lot of acting going on. Dakota Johnson seems pretty disinterested throughout and Sidney Sweeney shows everyone that she has the acting ability of a pair of cantaloupes.
sydshanks,1,If I could rate this lower than i would.,"Im begging you, if you are even having the slightest thought of seeing this garbage fire of a movie then please don't.The only half decent part about this movie was some of the cast, other than the villain that seemed to have a dub over the top of his voiceThis movie was horrific from the story-line, origin story, writing to the lines, the ending, visual effectsThe main character loosing her vision at the end was barley clear enough of what happened for her to loose itThe ending was cheesy and felt unfinished, furthermore it felt like the main character lost the warrant out for her arrest just disappeared and I left the theatre feeling unsatisfied and that I should have stayed at home and not spent the extra $20 on the movie snacks and just lost the $20 that I spent on the movie itself which felt like a scam in it's self considering that this did not feel like a movie at allI am disappointed in Sony because it feels as if they have just lost their good reputation of making good spider themed superhero movies following up Spider-man into the spider-verseDo better Sony."
stevenlesmeister-15066,7,Not that bad,"I honestly didn't hate this movie. I had a lot of fun during it and thought it was kinda good. Sure it wasn't the best movie ever made, but it doesn't have to be that, it's just a fun spider-man build up movie. I hope to see this universe expanded upon and think it actually has some potential. I hope at some point that actually do a spider man movie but the rush isn't as urgent as I thought before I saw the movie. I think this movie is being excessively criticized for being a less serious movie when compared to the mcu, I think the fact that it's not interconnected with 60 other movies actually plays to it's advantage. I normally don't write reviews, but I feel like I need to sand up for this movie a bit."
Sleepin_Dragon,3,This was a shocker.,"I went in to this film without a clue as to what it was about, I'd hoped for some sort of mystery or thriller, instead it's yet another drab, uninspiring superhero movie.Almost two hours of my life I won't be getting back, I can see now why the critics and cinema goers have slammed this film, it's dire.Something happens to our paramedic, and she soon starts to develop strange powers. . . Sounds like a good premise, sadly it was agonisingly dull, am I missing something, or does absolutely nothing happen?All bad, well there are a few interesting themes, that spider and the bumps in time were clever ideas, but sadly the majority of it was just bland.Cassie was almost impossible to like, and as such I couldn't care less what happened to her, what an uninspiring and blank character.The villain, what an absolute waste of time, he was devoid of character, just a stereotypical villainous man, no thought went into him at all, other than his sharp beard and hair.Painfully dull.3/10."
kcwlsw,8,A Web of Marvel Surprises,"Madame Web was a fine movie that introduces audiences to a lesser-known (my opinion) intriguing character and expands the Marvel universe in unexpected ways. Despite some reviews inaccurately downplaying its value, I found Madame Web to be refreshing and visually stunning.The movie brings forth a character with complexities and mysteries that kept me on the edge of my seat. The script balances exposition with action, allowing both long-time Marvel fans and newcomers to appreciate the narrative without feeling overwhelmed.From mind-bending sequences that reveal the character's psychic abilities to epic battles that unfold in the mystical realms, the movie is a visual feat. The CGI work is good, creating a world that feels fantastical and grounded in the Marvel aesthetic.One of the highlights for me was the introduction of lesser-known Marvel characters. Madame Web serves as a gateway to a new array of heroes and villains, expanding the Marvel Cinematic Universe in ways that excite me. The movie's ability to integrate these characters into the larger story without overshadowing the central plot is effective.It's unfortunate to see some reviews dismissing Madame Web with lower ratings, as the movie is a fresh perspective. The nuanced performance by the cast, led by an outstanding lead portrayal, adds layers to the characters, making them more than just two-dimensional comic book figures.I'm glad this film was made, and I encourage viewers to give it a chance despite some misleading reviews. With an 8 out of 10 stars, Madame Web swings into the Marvel cinematic world with finesse, leaving me eager for more web-spinning adventures."
helenmovies,7,Honest review,"I think that whoever said that this movie is terrible is overreacting. I actually enjoyed watching this movie but I can understand why someone could find it underwhelming or disappointing. It is not your typical marvel movie with superheroes or a lot of action but I truly think that if you go into the cinema with an open mind you will enjoy it . We can't expect every movie to be perfect or the way we imagined .Marvel is changing and we have to accept that , by hating on every single movie and show we won't achieve anything . The only part I didn't like was the ending i guess I wanted something more."
LordCommandar,5,Once again negative review are unwarranted.,"Once again the negative reviews are so unwarranted. This was definitely a watchable film, from all the things that are being produced with a lot of stuff that I don't just don't want to look at. It was truly refreshing to watch young girls acting like girls not into each other but being basic teenage girls into boys. Madam Web was not the greatest movie, nowhere near fantastical but it was definitely watchable without all the other stuff that I so don't care to watch in the films with all that sexual agenda mess....hint hint. I so don't understand the negative reviews on this film, because for 2024, this was definitely a decent one time popcorn watch, so don't really get the hate. I enjoyed it because it was regular people being regular for a change in a superhero film and it was quite refreshing if you understand how I'm saying it."
jespervanvoorst-83879,3,Very bad,"This movie was terrible, it felt like two different totally not coherent B movies combined together, neither being a superhero movie.Let's first say that the fact that Dakota Johnson was not really promoting this movie was already a red flag. The trailer made it look like a super hero movie, but while watching it I only saw someone running. No one really had any power the the one of madam webb were unreliable. In the end it felt more like a set up for a sequel,I still think that some lines in the movie were just extremely lame, ""when you take responsibility great power will come"", did they wanna say the uncle Ben quote but were they not allowed to do it because of licensing or was this just a joke???? Same as with the baby name reveal, i know they were not allowed to say his name was peter but pls these 20 minutes are completely wasted and could have been added to another part where the movie was lacking.The stupid Peru plot lead to literally nothing as well, she just left in the middle of the climax of the movie to just go to Peru talk to some guy and the just leave again without really doing anything.Idk what to say about this movie idek if it was enjoyably bad. I did laugh a few times but idk if these scenes were meant to be funny. Didn't hear someone else laugh in the theater at all tho."
friguracip86,2,Worst movie ever .,"God forbid, the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years, I don't think there is such a stupid movie. It doesn't even deserve a grade 1. A very poorly made script that's embarrassing. It's a shame that such bad movies are still being made. I'm sorry I'm saying it, but it's really a very bad movie, not worth watching. I couldn't imagine that in the year 2024 such bad films can still be made with such poor direction and with an even poorer story. It's incredible how some people can simply make fun of a film. I regret that I wasted my time with such movie.i litteraly hate this movie please erase it . Bye."
wolverinexfitxmma,3,NO PLACE ON THE SUPERHERO WORLD,"Absolute GARBAGE!!A failed attempt to try and expand the superhero world!!Special FX were ok, storyline was horrible, if they removed SpiderMan (Peter Parker) from marvel to put this one in its place is nonsense. No relationship to the MCU storyline and no reference to it. Absolute trash. I was waiting for a reference or at least something mentioned. 2003 was the timeframe used in the storyline. At least mention Tony Stark and Nick Fury. But these women characters were a disappointment. Cassie's character resembles Professor X. So I'm thinking these women need to train to become superhero's and be a team. My family and I felt the characters were weak ALL OF THEM!!! The bad guy was very weak!!! No real villain characters. The villain was bad, no power, no story or reference to his strength on how he became rich and his powers. Just the stealing of the spider and that's it. No reason to be attached to the character. We lost interest during the movie.The pace of the picture was way to slow!!! The character development was to slow to tell. We weren't impressed.It doesn't deserve the Marvel logo, or anything or attachments. Madame Web more like Madame Fleam.A negative -17 outta 10. If their goal is to make a trilogy or sequel to this has been planned then they failed miserably. The money they'll score from this will fund the sequels. Major failure.BAD BADLY BADNO INTEREST IN ITS SEQUELS IF ANYTHING IN THE WORKS. NO TIME TO WASTE MAKING IT.IF THEYRE CONNECTION IS TO MIX IT INTO X-MEN UNIVERSE THEN NO COMMENT. NO PROPS TO EVEN ENCOURAGE IT."
cccarden-90564,2,Beyond Expectations of Dreadful,"As a life long Spider-Man fan (over 40 years!) I have been riding the wave of the SpiderVerse on the big screen for 22 years, to varying degrees of quality. Sony's track record of handling the property has ranged from wise and productive (Tom Holland's Spidey and collaboration with the MCU) to .... this. Wow. Nothing about this film clicks, and for my wife and I, seeing it on opening night in an early empty theater, it was our own private episode of MST3K as we heckled one implausible plot development after another. Every heavy handed stab at connecting this film to a larger SpiderVerse was heavy handed and painful. Sidney Sweeney's visage, only redeemable aspect! Best to avoid, along with Venom/Morbius, and soon to no doubt be, Kraven the Hunter. Right up there with Catwoman."
Braidlance,1,HAHAHAHA,"Madame Web is a tedious experience. The acting is sooo bad and weird, making the entire film unintentionally hilarious. Unfortunately, what should probably be serious falls FLAT due to its overall very poor execution, leaving everyone more likely to laugh at its flaws than engage with the intended narrative. Which is absolutely meaningless and souless garbage.Here's some more for the ridiculous character limit. The plot lacks depth, and the pacing feels sluggish. Characters fail to evoke empathy, making it hard to invest in their journey. Madame Web fails to deliver a compelling cinematic experience, leaving viewers with a forgettable and unengaging film."
nikosstoitsis,6,"I have seen worse, don't deserve the hate.",I suppose not for Dakota and the new hot name in town Sydney no one would have cared. To be honest the second half of the film wasn't that bad and I would like to see madam web featured in future spider man film as mentor for Peter Parker with a rough start or because of Dr Strange even she do not who he is. Let's see what the future holds us as madam web do know. I believe to have introduced these characters in every movie like MCU did back in phase 1 but Morbius was such a disaster and Venom(s) could have gone better + the Kraven movie I'm almost positive it will a miss and run case. Let's see.
jmcd2007,1,An absolute trainwreck,"I didn't go into the theatre expecting much from this film after hearing about the poor reviews, but I took a chance on it anyway. I left even more disappointed than I thought.Everything about this film was terrible except a few camera shots and a few scores throughout the film. The story was all over the place and every actor in this film gave poor performances and came off as very wooden. Disney/Marvel and Sony should just throw in the towel on these superhero films because it is clear to me that after witnessing this abomination, that they simply don't have it. All of these companies should be completely ashamed of themselves for even greenlighting this.Disney, in particular, has seen a severe domino effect with their films as of late, with one box office bomb after another. At this point, Disney should just hit the pause button on making films in general, because they've completely lost their magic. Based on the reviews of their recent films, many audiences agree. Perhaps a change in leadership might be the best option here?In summary, I can't stress enough how AWFUL this film truly is. It easily qualifies as one of the worst films that I had the misfortune of seeing this year. Don't waste your time or money by going to the theatre to see it. Don't even stream it. If you must watch, I'd recommend wearing one of those sleep eye masks and clogging your ears with cement beforehand."
darrendear,8,Love this film despite of and because of it's flaws,"Okay I'm going to be honest, I love this movie. That doesn't mean I can't see its flaws or its unintentional laughable moments. I love it despite and because of these. Firstly Dakota Johnson is actually well cast in the role. Okay so she is just playing Dakota Johnson, but her laid back style actually works with the character's initial reluctance to be a hero. Also the three actresses playing the teenagers (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor) are well cast and very good in their roles. Adam Scott is also very likeable as Ben Parker, Peter's future ill-fated uncle. The baddie Ezekiel Sims isn't as good, but in a way that is hilariously unintentionally entertaining... especially as part of the actor's dialogue seems to be dubbed. There are also plenty of unintentional hilarious lines, although sadly that famous one from the trailer doesn't make it into the final movie. It is obvious this film's story changed during production, the casting of Emma Roberts as Mary Parker hints that the character would have had a bigger role in the film's early Terminator-style draft. Ultimately though, I found this film entertaining from start to finish. It's set in 2003 and this film could have easily been made then. I actually enjoyed the smaller scale, no end of the world stuff here...just Dakota protecting three teenagers. The final showdown at the fireworks factory works well and yes I would happily watch a sequel with this cast to see how the three girls get their powers. Sadly it won't happen, but at the very least this film deserves to become a cult film."
siderite,6,Wasn't THAT bad,"You know you're in for it when most of the reviews are either 1s or 5s, but you expect it to be a film that you either love or hate. Instead you get a mediocre superhero movie.I don't really care about the politics of the thing, the extensive reshoots, the changing of the story by committee until there was nothing artistic left, I only care if I enjoy watching the film. And it wasn't good, but it wasn't unwatchable either. It made just as much sense as The Flash, but it featured young women and there were no cameos from famous actors or characters. If it were not a ""spider-movie"" and it was just a random studio making a film, I would have said ""meh!"" so this is also my rating.It has a lot of pacing and editing issues and very little actual action, but its greatest sin as far as I am concerned is that it's boring. Honestly, it's got the structure of a video game: the plot is linear, the characters are barely sketched and everything that you see has some direct and immediate impact on the plot. If you need something to happen in another place, the movie instantly goes there, unless there is some interest in heightening the drama, in which case you get a scene that makes no sense like the one with the log truck. And obviously, the ending sucks, because no one in Hollywood seems to be able to write one anymore.I would have rated it lower, but I see it was hatefully rating-bombed already, so there is no point in it. My advice is to relax, grab some food and a drink and enjoy this like any other silly TV movie."
morganweetman,5,A solid 5,"It seems like this movie is being punished for not living up to the usual high standard for superhero films, but if you look at other movies with the same (currently ~3.5) rating, this is well above in my opinion.I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely watchable, and anything watchable rates at least a 5. Yes, it could have been better, but it wasn't.. not every production comes out polished to perfection.Normally I wouldn't watch anything with a sub-5 rating, but I couldn't believe that it could be as bad as the reviews were saying.It isn't a blockbuster, so let go of your expectations, sit back, and you'll likely enjoy the movie."
jacquesvanzyl-75383,5,Get caught in Cassie's web!,"Madame Web, the fourth entry in the Sony's Spider-Man Universe brings us a different take on a complete new group of heroes in the heart of New York. I need to caution the readers that when going to watch the movie, keep an open mind. This movie is about Madame Web and her role as a protector to three young women who will play a much greater role in future...hopefully. If you are expecting Peter Parker / Spider-Man to swing in and catch a crook, you will sadly be disappointed.I firmly welcome the new take on the Spider-Women within Marvel. Since Across the Spider-Verse I have pondered the question on whether we will get a chance to see any of the Spider-Women on the big screen and also the 'How?'. I have always seen Cassandra Webb / Madame Web play a motherlike and protector role. I personally think Dakota Johnson played her part excellently well in that sense.Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor plays the parts of Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin and delivers a breath of fresh air. They are teased to play big roles in the future, according to the villain in the movie. The new villain of the movie, played by Tahar Rahim, provides a thrilling experience at first but gets taken down too easily at the end.Madame Web provided a good introduction to a new character, which is Madame Web, but sadly doesn't provide any promise of continuity and linkages with any of the existing movies within the current universe. A few easter eggs in the movie point to another beloved Marvel character, but I would have loved to experience more of Cassie's web and the chance of a teaser for the other heroines of the movie since there are still so much stories left to tell. There is unfortunately no post-credits scene, which was a let down, considering Madame Web is part of the Sony Spider-Man Universe and continuity is what many are hopeful for. I'm curious if we get to see continuity later in the form of a sequel or even a cameo of Cassie, Julia, Mattie and / or Anya in any other production.I rate this movie 5 out of 10.The trailer doesn't spoil too much of the storyline. Make sure to catch at a big screen near you."
Lvgerrard,1,If ChatGPT Made a Superhero Movie,"Too many poor aspects of this film to touch on in a short review, but to summarize: it you prompted AI to write a superhero script it would be better written than this. One-liners are incredibly cheesy & formulaic. Plot is ridiculous & feels like it was dreamed up by a 3rd grader (""mom was researching spiders in the Amazon"").Truly felt like the whole thing was a spoof, from the acting to the set design to the failed attempts at being funny. I swear the bad guy's accent changed with every line. Honestly I'd recommend it if you want to laugh at something for 2 hours with some friends. Has to be rock bottom for the Spider-Man spin offs."
drjgardner,5,Not as bad as...,"Given how bad some of the most recent superhero films have been, this one isn't that bad. That doesn't mean it's good, it's just not that bad.Good things -The acting is really good, especially from the 3 teenage girls. They steal every scene they are in.Editing - really nice. A lot of the flashbacks and flash forwards are done so well they created interest and tension.Plot - it's ok too. A bit far-fetched but it's a movie and it's a superhero movie so the fetched isn't that far.Bad stuffContinuity - ok it's a superhero film but it still needs to have continuity.Loopholes - not related to the poor continuity, there are so many holes in the story you could drive a million giant spiders through it."
bxhanx,3,Not worth the price of the ticket,"The producers and director worked incredibly hard to impregnate every super hero cliché possible in this laughable movie.This plodding, pedantic foray into a pre-teen girl's fantasy is painful. The acting is nothing short of horrible. The script is ridiculously predictable. Perhaps worse, is the fact that the villain could get hit full speed by an ambulance and taxi and bounce back, yet get taken out by a metal sign.The action is... isn't...One thing is readily apparent; They are working hard to make M. Web into a Charles Xavier-type superhero mentor and advisor. It doesn't work.The laughable glasses she sports in the end are so absurd that they aren't even slightly funny. The fact that they put this blind caricature of a superhero in a motorized wheelchair added to this farce of an action, superhero movie.This film has no redeeming qualities. The direction, the action, the inconsistencies, the acting, the effects, all fall short of even the most basic requirements for a somewhat decent superhero movie.The only thing worse would be if they made a sequel. Hopefully this ludicrous franchise dies here.Madame Web isn't worth your time."
hjgdctqb,5,Genuinely not bad at all.,"This movie really seems to be over-hated by critics. I understand superhero fatigue is hitting fans and critics, but this movie is a fun semi-cheesy nod to the early 2000's. The villain's dialogue and the actor's speech would not match up at times making the scenes feel distracting to the story when he would appear on screen, but that was an editing choice probably in post production. If you go into the movie with the knowledge that it's a Sony Marvel film and you don't have the expectations of an MCU film, it'll be a decent watch. The CGI and special effects were well done. Besides that, the story of Cassandra Web and the three future Spider-Women will hopefully be explored further down the line."
Maeve43,7,Not a bad little movie.,"I want to start off by saying that when the MCU first took off my family were always first in line for every movie, and we stayed until the house lights came up. My youngest used to get mad and yell at people when they left before the stingers. Then Avengers Endgame came and we had the loud, large, raucous ending we had waited for for 11 years. And oh my it was a truly sad but satisfactory ending. Marvel dialed things back after that, but not enough. They were still trying too hard to reach Endgame levels. You can't top that. Nothing will ever be able to top that, and because they kept trying, almost everything except No Way Home, WandaVision, Loki and GotG3 has been just ""eh"" or in Quantumania and Secret Invasions' case, very extremely sub-par. The Marvels was a decent movie, I didn't hate it, but again, still trying too hard. We're done with it all connecting. I don't have the mental energy for that road again. But here comes Madame Webb. This movie is not a 10, not even an 8, but it's WAY better than some others are saying it is. It was nice to just watch a singular movie. There is a low key nod to the Spider-Man universe, did you catch it? No, this movie won't win any awards, it isn't full of over the top CGI fights and robots and tech, but it was not bad at all. We enjoyed it. I paid full price for tickets and don't regret it. Will I watch it again? Of course, when it hits streaming. It's a perfectly good way to spend a weekend afternoon. All four leading ladies did very nice jobs with what they were given to work with, and if there's a sequel, I'll go see that as well."
Redhead_Reviewer,4,Sony... Please... Stick to animated Spider-Man,"I feel like I might have given Madame Web the highest rating here. I didn't hate the movie by any means, but there's very little to enjoy that isn't outweighed by either the bad or the boring.None of the cast stands out, and a lot of their lines are delivered in pretty flat ways. It doesn't help that the script is super bloated. They could've easily cut 30% of the dialogue without needing to cut any of the runtime with how many pointless lines there are.The use of dynamic camera movements is super distracting at times, and at others pretty nauseating. A few of the moments worked, but otherwise the only positive is that they made me appreciate the steady scenes more. And while I tend to not notice bad CGI as much as others, I did notice it here (partially because it was pointed out to me, but even if it hadn't been I think I'd have picked up on it in certain moments).Since 2018, Sony has given us both masterpieces and master-misses of Spider-Man content. The Playstation games have been amazing, and Spider-Verse is just one unreleased movie away from a perfect trilogy. On the other hand, their live-action Spider-Man-less movies supposed to be set in that universe just do not work. I'm only taking the word of the public on Morbius and Let There Be Carnage, but Venom was very disappointing, and while I wasn't expecting much from Madame Web, it's another movie I won't return to."
martinpersson97,8,It's pretty okay,"As many would expect something more binary, where I would either call this film ""massively underrated"" or ""terrible"", I prefer to look at it in more nuanced ways.This film, in my opinion, is rather inoffensive in every way. It is just a rather bland, typical and fun super hero blockbuster, nothing terrible, and offers a rather good time in the absence of other similar Marvel movies for a while.The actors all do their best, the action scenes and effects are rather solid it provides a rather clichéd, yet servicable script.I can so no real problem with this film, and feel some people should calm down a bit when it comes to these kinds of films. It is not high cinema or anything."
gamegaumum,6,Not so bad if you're a Spider-Man universe fans,"This movie is far from MCU standards, but again it's not a MCU production.If you expecting alot of action, what you got here is less than that.The story still good, maybe it's better if the title is Madam Web the beginning, so viewers can accept that as the start of journey.For me this movie is more like the Marvel side of Birds of Prey.The script, the angle and action is more like TV serials.The costume is OK, but not for the makeups.The best way to enjoy this movie is knowing the characters from the comic book first, it will help alot to enjoy the movie.Again it's good in story but not so much in others."
jeffybogay,1,This movie should win an award!,"For being the longest PepsiCo advert slash CPR training video ever. Wtf.I was late to watching this movie because of the reviews, and fool that I am, I still decided to see it in its last week at my theatre. I booked my tickets a mere 1 hour before the screening, and found that not a single other seat had been purchased. I should have seen this as an omen to turn tail and flee.The movie was unwatchable in terms of acting. I don't like to put down new actors, but come on, I'm sure the Pepsi money could put to good use in this regard. Or maybe use it to hire actual writers, instead of what I can only assume was an LLM. Even the experienced actors couldn't make anything in this script sound even remotely human! (Though that could have just been a lack of trying).There's more one could say, but I've thought about this movie enough for my lifetime.P. S.If you make the foolish decision to watch this movie, at least do it at a licensed cinema."
TheHarbingerOfReason,1,The John Cena film Freelance is rated higher than this... Tells you what you need to know.,"Overwhelming the harshest critics of this movie have been my female, genre loving friends. They don't even get the hot girl factor in this film which is meant to draw in the young male side of the audience. Which means it's actually a failure on every point aside from the appeal they aimed for towards men by casting only young super attractive females. Now the other side of that coin is that one of them admitted she hated the fact only attractive women are cast as super heroes. Could it be that in trying to pull the Michael bay cord and fill the cast with hotties, they actually pushed the jealous girl contingent out of the theatre as well? Can't wait for the social debrief on why this failed miserably."
cindyrellaexists,1,Drip...drip...drip Dakota was B-O-R-I-N-G,I think lot was the casting. Dakota is known for her monotone lackluster voice and emotionless face who has absolutely no charisma so why put her as a lead in a 'superhero' movie. She doesn't have the strong presence to carry anything. The story could have been delivered much better because it had potential especially with the other cast members. The visuals were subpar with what you can expect with these moments vies snd yeh yeh the costumes were creative. The lead was just annoying and cringey to not only watch but have to listen to. It was so annoying to hear Dakota utter a word.Nice try but no.
rpcarnell,3,Amazingly incoherent,"Wanna watch a movie full of coincidences, plot holes, cheesy dialogue, and an incoherent plot? This is your film then.Cassandra Webb is an awkward paramedic who develops the ability to see the future after a near-death accident. Keep in mind her mom was bitten by a spider before giving birth, so it is safe to assume her power to see the future is spider-related, no matter how ridiculous this is.The three girls Cassie saves from evil Spiderman are supposed to become superheroes in the future, but it is never explained how. The bad guy, well, he is the bad guy, and he has a sidekick, some woman helping him find the girls. At least we know her gender. And we know the bad guy is wealthy. We don't know how he makes his money though.Spoilers ahead.The movie is saturated with plot holes and incoherencies. Girls go to a diner, and a guy sees their picture in a newspaper and recognizes them as the three missing girls. They have been missing for only a few hours. How fast were newspapers published in 2003? And the biggest stupidity of them all: Cassie leaves the girls at her friend's house and goes to Peru to learn more about her powers. She was gone for a week. A lot could've happened in a week.If you like bad movies, this is the movie for you. There are no redeeming qualities here."
johnnyhbtvs27,1,The Worst Episode Of That's So Raven Ever,"How can Madame Web possibly be so bad? Let's dissect:I had the misfortune to see this in IMAX and it makes the vision scenes even worse, causing a jolt every time they happen with ridiculous loud noises and shaky cam. It was like a really bad episode of That's So Raven.How studio executives could watch the opening 10 minutes of this and think the amazon stuff was good enough is mind-boggling.Tahar Rahim is the worst comic book villian that has ever been put on screen. His line delivery is dreadful to the point it makes you wonder if he was going out his way to play stereotypical villian A.Dakota Johnson clearly was very awkward playing against the green screen and would give Kristen Stewart in Twilight a run for her money in terms of stilted performance.The product placement in this movie is something to behold. Never in my life have i seen a product endorsed so blatantly like the Pespi endorsements. Having Dakota Johnson hold a can of Pespi for a solid two minutes of screen time is ludicrous.S. J. Clarkson the director is simply not experienced enough to tackle such a big budget movie with so much green screen. For this to be her first movie and handed a property like this. Crazy.All the stuff relating to the Parkers, especially Ben, is done so heavy handed. Having Adam Scott playing Ben Parker is so ridiculous and does nothing to help the film.No one comes out of this with any dignity, even Sydney Sweeney is awful in a rather mute role. She is given nothing to do and doesn't get a moment to stand out either.The end scene with Dakota Johnson & Tahar Rahim and the close up as she says ""i am"" in relation to his downfall is the worst scene and zoom shot i can recall seeing in a big budget studio movie.Not having the Spider-Women in costume (bar in visions) was a strange one. At the end of the movie it eludes to future suit ups but this movie is that bad there will be no chance of that ever occurring.A shambles of a movie."
drucifer777,1,Wow!,"Honestly, this whole movie felt like it was written as they filmed it. And when they thought they had a great idea, whether it made sense or not they just made up some outrageous plot point with no back story or explanation to make it fit. Honestly, this is so bad I feel bad for every B-level actor/actress associated with it who most likely only took the rolls to keep a roof over their heads. If you didn't know shockingly it's not even Disney!! Which honestly disappointed me as I'd love nothing more than see another Disney film flop. I have to call out terrible, and this is it. From its comedic product placement, the poor editing, the non-sensical plot, and worst of all the direction, there is nothing redeeming about this movie."
neil-476,7,Don't believe all the negativity,"Cassie is a paramedic, daughter of a scientist mother who was murdered by the mysterious Ezekiel while researching spiders in the Amazon: an Amazonian tribe of spider-type natives delivered Cassie. She finds herself having flashes of the future, leading to her becoming involved with three teenaged girls.This film is getting some highly negative feedback, and I was expecting the worst. I was pleasantly surprised: it's not bad. It's not great, either - it is somewhat muddled in terms of exposition: given that this is essentially a superhero origin story, it would have been helpful to have ended up with a coherent explanation of who had what powers and how, but no.But at its heart, we have a character who is emotionally disconnected, and who begins to change even before learning the reason why. Cassie is likeable, as are two of the three teens, and even the third one has made progress by the end.I admit that I'm easily pleased, but I think this film, like Marvels, is actually quite a lot better than the impression you will probably have got."
atorresmercadeo,2,Mediocre. Garbage.,"Mediocre. Bad script, bad production, poor interpretations. I felt like I was watching a meaningless movie. It's okay. It's boring. Sony hung up and they splash Sydney Sweeney's race, which is the only decent thing about the movie. In general, garbage. I gave him 2/10 but honestly I'm being generous.Jared's movie Morbius is much better and that's a lot to say, because it's another garbage of history. They have to stop making superhero or anti-hero movies just because of them, without looking for meaning and how to develop future projects. This movie is lower than the mediocre category. I'm c."
aahodge-37016,9,GOOOOOD ASS MOVIE,"My best friend and i went into the movie with all the bad ratings in mind but simply put i believe it had a great storyline. If they continue with the characters we will definitely be ones to watch is as this one is a great opener for future movies. The reviews on this page really took me by surprise considering how enjoyable the movie was. I enjoyed the variety and representation in the characters, it's quite refreshing to see more women and poc in marvel movies, as main characters of course. I enjoyed the level of super abilities and the detailed and context as to how they were obtained. I enjoyed the emotional aspects as well, i laughed and cried at certain moments and feel if given a chance, this film truly could be the start of many greats."
kati-72719,7,Too much unnecessary hate,"I'm just going to leave this here in hopes that someone out there might still have an unspoiled self-critic bone in their body.This movie DOES BOT DESERVE ALL THE HAT IT GOT. It is entertaining, funny at times and it's a different experience then what we've been watching regarding super heroes for sometime.Not the typical ""ohh, I'm a superhero now, so of course I can fight and be a badass just because"".In this sense, at least they kept it real. Sure, it's not deserving of an Oscar, but let's be real, what superhero movie usually does.There is one aspect that kind of got me off, which is the obvious unexplained reason as to why Cassie ended up in a wheelchair. Seems like they might have cut a scene that they really shouldn't have.Anyways, I watched it now, a few months after all the negative hype, and guess what, wasn't that bad! So there it is. To all the haters out there, just stop! What are you getting out of this?! You are the reason so many good movies and stories aren't getting done because of this right here!"
egilostebovik,2,It's astonishingly bad. Please watch something else.,"Diving into 'Madam Web' with the hope of unearthing a superhero gem felt like expecting a gourmet meal at a fast-food joint-optimistic but woefully naive. Now, I tread lightly when critiquing superhero flicks with female leads, not because they're sacred cows, but because it's easy to get lost in the ""shitstorm reviews"". However,CGI: Madam Web seems to have raided a high school AV club's closet for its special effects. The visuals are so unconvincing you'll find yourself wondering if the budget was spent on pizza parties rather than production.And the plot? Oh, the plot is a tapestry of absurdity that makes you question if it was written during a game of Mad Libs. We're somehow in 2002, but everyone's rocking 4K CCTV like it's Black Friday at the tech store.The talent of the leads, trapped in this whirlwind of WTF. You keep hoping for a moment of redemption that never comes, unless you count the end credits as a merciful release.My advice? If you're in the mood for a superhero movie that feels like a journey through the uncanny valley with a side of time-traveling tech, 'Madam Web' might just be your ticket. For the rest of us, there are about a thousand other ways to better spend a couple of hours-like alphabetizing your sock drawer or watching paint dry in 4K, which, incidentally, might have a more coherent plot.In the end, 'Madam Web' is a reminder that not all heroes wear capes; some just bravely endure bad movies so others don't have to. Do yourself a favor and let this web stay unspun."""
kddpngpy,4,Terrible story,"Cast is great, and 3 of the stars are meant for Sweeney, she doesn't even have speak, that said, the movie is not tied together with the terrible spaghetti story, it has more loose ends than a big portion and feels half cooked. Can highly recommend taking a hike instead or just two hours of a nap. From beginning to the end the dialog is.tame and half wit, you would think they would come up with a little more fun, after all it's part of the Spider-Man universe, but apparently it's only Peter Parker who can be funny. And don't start to talk about being a clairvoyant, it's bad enough as it is, supermovies are so last year."
cinemapersonified,2,Terrible Movie,"Rating: 2.1
Overall, a terrible movie that makes Argylle seem like Citizen Kane as it feels like they tried to make a watchable movie out of terrible footage, but I got more enjoyment from the man snoring next to me because he showed more emotion than the entire cast.Terrible Direction (The direction on a macroscale was terrible because they did such a bad job at building the world and establishing the conflict (they just forced what time period the movie took place); the direction on a microscale was atrocious as the whole movie was incredibly monotonous and all of the interpersonal scenes were just laughable bad (especially towards the end); the direction of actors was terrible because all the performances were incredibly monotonous and there was no chemistry in the entire cast; the storytelling was unfocused as she had no idea where she wanted to take this movie, it felt like they were telling the story while the script was still being made; she forces the tension so much that you don't care what happens to the characters; the cut for this movie was incredibly bad because it felt like they tried to Frankenstein a film on bad footage), Very Bad Acting (Very Bad from Dakota Johnson (Shows that she is nepotism personified as I have never seen someone put as little effort into a lead performance as her; her whole character is incredibly monotonous that it rubs off on all the other actors; she is so useless in the action scenes that it makes me wonder why even make a movie on Madame Web; she has no chemistry with the rest of the cast; her performance wasn't terrible because she does have some moments that were fine, but most of these are in the exposition), Bad to Pretty Bad from Sydney Sweeney (Her character is given nothing to work with as it is obvious she is trying to make something with what she has, but in the end, it is clear that the script is just too bad to put in a decent performance), Pretty Bad to Decent from Isabela Merced (She shows as much charisma and timing that the writing can let her), Very Bad to Bad from Celeste O'Connor (Mostly just annoying because her performance just felt so forced), Terrible from Tahar Rahim (Might be one of the worst performances in a big budget movie I have ever seen as his accent and tone were just so off that it made me cringe whenever he was on screen; not menacing at all because his character is just so poorly written; has no chemistry with any of the cast (especially Dakota Johnson)), Pretty Bad from Mike Epps (Comedic relief for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad from Emma Roberts (Just plays herself for like 5 minutes), Pretty Bad to Decent from Adam Scott (Feels like Robin Williams compared to the rest of the cast as he has decent comedic timing and tries to establish as much chemistry with Dakota Johnson as he can), Very Bad from the rest of the cast (All the extras/side-characters feel like this was their first job)), Terrible Story (The concept is just so stupid because none of what was going on felt interesting, and the conflict makes no sense because it feels forced; the plot structure was pretty formulaic, but the main issue is that the plot elements make no sense and are incredibly forced; there are many plot holes and continuity issues; flow between sequences is terrible because it feels like they forcing are where the plot is going to go; the character writing is some of the worst I have ever seen for a comic book as Madame Web is the most boring/uninteresting superhero I have ever seen, and the villain is so poorly written because his origin makes no sense and his conflict just feels so forced; the movie has this weird relationship with the Spider-man franchise because they tried so hard to show that it's in the universe, but as the same time subvert any reference they try to make), Terrible Screenplay (The dialogue is atrocious as none of what was said made sense (it felt like the script was written by an 8th grader whose homework was to write a superhero script), notable lines being 'you did it, you did it' and 'every day that goes by, my appointment with death comes closer'; the humor is so dry and forced that it was funnier when they were trying to be serious (making this a contender to be a fun bad movie); the symbolism is so overt because they try to push this concept of the family so hard, but the movie is just so bad that you don't care; foreshadowing is a key plot element for this movie as the visions help predict what was going to happen, but the issue is this element is saturated throughout the movie and it is sometimes not clear what is a vision and what is actually happening), Bad Score (The score was pretty formulaic and was just so poorly used/mixed in), Bad Cinematography (More polished than Morbious, but is still very bad in the fight scenes as they try to do so much), Terrible Sound (The ADR was atrocious as there were moments where dialogue was said without mouths moving; I genuinely feel that they hated all the footage they shot, but it was so expensive to reshoot that they tried to make the most with what they could), Terrible Editing (The number of fast cuts is nauseating as it made the movie not coherent; the way they only sometimes differentiated what was a vision and what was the present made the movie unnecessarily confusing), Very Bad Visual Effects (Over-saturated and looks incredibly fake), Very Bad Production Design (Everything looks like it's on a blue-screen), Decent Makeup, Decent Costumes (They have costumes for less than a minute just so they could use it in the promos), Pacing is pretty slow as they try so hard to make it feel longer than it needed to be (and the visions/sharp edits disrupted this flow so much that it was a chore to get through this movie); the runtime could have been cut 30 minutes and the movie still would have been a nightmare, Climax is so poorly constructed because it felt like it was directed by Michael Bay from Temu with how they excessively used visual effects (and felt so forced with its character revelations), Tone is a big issue for this movie because they tried to make a fun superhero movie (but everyone's tone is just so monotonous that this never comes into fruition), The old man obnoxiously snoring next to me showed more emotion than the entire cast of this movie."
TMAuthor23,2,Classic Case Of A Poorly Directed Film,"Bear with me, and read this all the way through.When you produce a film in a certain genre, you have to acknowledge what the demographic in the viewership is. And what they want. That doesn't mean that you can't feature a strong female lead. What it does mean is that the writing has to be good, and so do the performances. Alien, Aliens, Terminator Judgement Day, Wonder Woman, Edge Of Tomorrow, The Help, The Hurt Locker, Hidden Figures, A Quiet Place, Salt. All well written, and well acted.How many screw ups does it take to learn a lesson? The Marvels? She-Hulk? Charlie's Angels (with Kristen Stewart), the all female Ghostbusters, the 355, Ocean's 8, blah, blah, blah....blah.None of the performances resonate. That's either a casting problem or a director problem. In this movie it might be both. I watched the whole movie and can't for the life of me recall any of the spider girls' names; just Johnson's Cassie, because all the girls, and fellow EMT's, kept screaming her name throughout the movie.There are so many bad parts: stay here I'm going to Peru (which was a nonsensical mess); why are the girls all abandoned in one way or another?; NO character development; Sweeney's character is an apologetic shrinking violet (but she gets up on a table in a restaurant to dance...as people do), the black teen is a toxic, snotty elite; the Hispanic girl is a Dreamer who doesn't want to attract attention. But those are all verbalized exposition. We aren't SHOWN anything. And as a result we aren't made to care about what happens to them.Cassie's scenes where she's experiencing future forecasting or revelations aren't well handled (director), and during the climactic battle scene those out of focus weird montages disappear and we're supposed to see the death of the villain as orchestrated by Cassie because she can see the future. Again, badly done.Then there's the plot and tone of the movie. They are at odds with each other. There are beats that want to call back to Sam Raimi's original Spider-Man. Unfortunately the entire thread centered on the villain is full of problems: his performance, how he escaped the jungle Spider-Man tribe in the first place, how he managed to cull photographic facial sketches from dreams, how he fails at capturing at least ONE of the spider girls. Cassie is somehow revealed to be a world class demolition car driver. Apparently necessary because she spends significant screen time behind the wheel of a vehicle.The dialogue, and jokey delivery in dire circumstances is just plain awful. Witness a bunch of deaths, and crack jokes while riding in a stolen car? Not believable. Drive said car into a forest (because that's what a person does) and demand that the three teenagers (who are not impressed by Johnson) ""stay put, and no dumb stuff"". Excuse me, what? The teens, who have witnessed multiple deaths, decide to leave a secluded area and go to a public diner...and dance on a table in front of a group of boys? Sure, that makes sense. Seriously, this movie staggers along with the most unlikely of events. Think back on the original Spider-Man comparison: Peter is a kid with extraordinary powers, navigating through believable personal challenges, while his superhero alter-ego fights extraordinary problems. Cassie's path is almost completely backward. And her transition to all-knowing Madam Webb at the end? Laugh out loud bad.And Dakota Johnson? Not an actress with the chops to do this right. And apparently her line delivery was so problematic that she had to re-dub much of her dialogue during looping. And it wasn't improved through that process. And, it's shocking to witness an actor on a press tour bad mouth the movie they're supposed to be promoting.It was rumored that Garfield or Maguire might appear. Must have gotten lost in the multiple (rarely a good sign) rewrites.But Hollywood loves money, and the opportunity to siphon some from a successful brand. Tom Holland's terrific Spider-Man trilogy has encouraged Sony to produce more films in the same universe...to mixed results.And lest you think this just about a female driven IP, specifically, there's...ugh...Morbius.What a shame."
makab-87460,3,Wasted Potential,"Wasn't expecting a massive amount from it other than a fun movie but struggled to find solace in even that.I know it was set in 2003 but wasn't wholely expecting the tone to match the cheesy comic book movies of that era too.The ""Spider-women"" are wasted in this movie, with the actual heroes only glimpsing in a couple of fleeting moments and the Clairvoyance factor of Madame Web herself just feels forced and overly Digital for the most part.The villain is portrayed as a spoof ripped straight from a slapstick screenplay and quite honestly makes a mockery of his performance.Had potential to be another strong Female led cast with some amazing talent but unfortunately falls flat by its end."
i-cazeprod,1,Sony stop !!!!,"Sorry for my english.Gentlemen executives of Sony and Marvel, have you actually seen the film??? Is there a pilot on board? We have reached such a low level that your film cannot even fit into the category of narrative, even Morbius is a masterpiece compared to this one. Your screenwriters are a disgrace to the profession. The realization is catastrophic and epileptic!!! The special effects are shameful but certainly not the fault of the technicians, you must have put more pressure on them (do the work in 2 months instead of a year of post-production). The acting is non-existent, my 4 year old son plays comedy better than your actors. In short, I'm sick of your latest films. From now on, I will no longer go to see your films in the cinema... you have crossed the limits and taken the spectators for idiots. Goodbye forever !"
allyours-49828,7,Stop hopping on the bandwagon what's wrong with people ?,"The movie may not be as great as some marvel flicks but this is a decent movie. And any too low rating submitted here is simply impulsive and for the sake of its previous bad reviews, I mean, people follow majority opinion but that majority opinion is not always right, right ? ...Its plot is somewhat predictable yet the story as a whole isn't too draggy given multiple action scenes.I can confidently give 7 rating at least. Stop jumping on the some bandwagon of some weird popular trend created by some fringe haters.All these haters really think it deserves that one star rating ? I do not think so."
andehhh,1,Awful,"I watched this last night and as expected, not very good at all.For one, i knew nothing about this 'superhero' Madame Web and as a huge Spiderman fan, was shocked to see that they are linked.The storyline is just so bad is almost a joke. From start to finish there was nothing exciting happening. Underwhelming action, bad characters, weird and boring dialogue. There is no CGI and the bits that do, look like a Bollywood movieWhoever thought of putting Dakota Johnson as the main character needs to be fired. 50 shades of boring.Pepsi clearly sponsored the movie as their named Cans are dotting all over the place.Dont waste your time with this."
Jamie-sewell-007,8,"Great fun movie, does not deserve any of these bad reviews.","Unbelievable I was not expecting this movie to be slated as much as this I actually really enjoyed it. To be honest with you I think people have really missed the whole point in going to the cinema these days. There is lots of fun to be had in this movie, it was a very interesting and original storyline. Obviously this movie is no ""inception"" or something like that but for what it is it's a very good fun movie with a very compelling storyline which perfectly perfectly interweave itself into the marvel universe. I also thought the movie ""Morbius"" was a very good film but that also got completely slated. It seems to be the Marvel fan boys that have problems with these movies. I think they've forgotten what original movie making and going to the cinema is all about !"
bahaata,6,Better than rating here... Not perfect but better than The Marvels,"I recently watched ""Madame Webb"", a joint venture between Sony and Marvel. Despite Sony and Marvel having produced significantly inferior movies in the past, I found this one to be more entertaining and engaging compared to many other introductory superhero films. The portrayal of women and young girls is handled better and fits more naturally into the narrative than in other female-centric Marvel films. I couldn't comprehend the exceedingly low ratings it received, which motivated me to write this review. Ratings as low as 3 should be reserved for absurdities like flying sharks. For instance, ""The Marvels"" was a disappointment, and I couldn't get through the first 10 minutes. I refuse to believe that ""Madame Webb"" deserves an average rating of 3.8. Yes, Madame Webb was portrayed as a goddess-like hero in my childhood over 35 years ago, but the casting for both the lead actress and the supporting actors was commendable. Admittedly, the villain lacked depth, and the film is far from perfect. However, it was significantly more entertaining and engaging than ""The Marvels"", compelling me to stay till the end."
depaulapimenta,1,What in the actual Frak!,"A movie so mediocrely bad, it over-dubbed the voice of the main villain without ANY concerning for lip-syncing.I caught it hoping it would be Wiseau's the Room bad... but it's just tedious, contrived, badly written, horribly acted, putridly paced and oh so mundane...Maybe it will make money because if you told me it t cost 10 million to make I'd believe you.I didn't think any one could be a girl-boss team up movie worse than ""Captain Marvel 2: Downgraded in Her Own Sequel"" but here we are.Some of it I had to watch through my hands as I covered my face in shame.It's one of those movies you don't even dare to laugh at cuz you feel deep pity and shame for all involved.At least now we know why formerly HBOMax canned the Game of Thrones spin off pilot SJ Clarkson had ""directed""Don't believe me? See it for yourself.I wouldn't wish it upon my enemies, but hey do you!"
Godfather0219,5,"Yo, Madame Web Ain't Half Bad","Giving a Boost to Madame Web: I loved it and it's not as bad as some say, but the toxic legacy of ""Venom"" and ""Morbius"" hindered it from being better.Sony Pictures' attempt at a Marvel Cinematic Universe is arguably one of the biggest jokes in modern Hollywood history. They are desperately clinging to Spider-Man side characters to build a Spider-Man universe without Spider-Man, churning out one stylishly retro, lazily plotted B-movie after another, barely masking their threadbare budgets with A-list stars and half-hearted special effects.Despite the derision piled onto the Venom films and Morbius, the accusations of riding Marvel's coattails, the snark that this whole endeavor just extends their Spider-Man rights, Sony soldiers on undeterred.Madame Web continues the trend of odd casting choices and dated aesthetics, but surprisingly doesn't have a lazy plot. I don't mean to say it's particularly clever, but calling it ""lazy"" would be unfair.Unlike the pure popcorn entertainment of Venom and Morbius reveling in their own shlock value, Madame Web shows real effort to tell a grounded story. In fact, it's the only Sony Marvel entry I genuinely enjoy despite its flaws, because parts of it sincerely worked for me.The core concept is interesting - a superhero movie intentionally subverting expectations by avoiding bombastic set pieces. It ingeniously incorporates slasher film tropes, recasting the superhero origin as a more economical small-scale thriller. This mashup is fresh and full of potential, allowing budget-conscious Sony to trim the fat while pioneering new ground for the genre. With the right execution, Madame Web could have finally been a decent meal from the Sony universe kitchen.From the trailers, Madame Web exudes The Terminator vibes. Dakota Johnson is Sarah Connor meets Kyle Reese protecting the young ""Spider Women"" who are the Johnnys. The Ezekiel is the T-800/Skynet. Madame Web's precognitive powers make her the harbinger of doom in each Terminator chapter, while the Spider Proteges are the ill-fated victims connected by fate.These homages are why I found it hard to dislike, even enjoyed, Madame Web. But what truly resonated was its core theme of motherhood over heroics. It would have been more fitting as a Mother's Day than Valentine's Day release.At its heart, Madame Web is a movie about motherhood (echoing The Terminator), about daughters finding surrogate mothers, about profound love and unconventional family. The emotional emphasis is unlike anything in Venom or Morbius, not just plot devices but the true backbone.Madame Web's mother died in childbirth, leaving her with a lifelong estrangement from others. She won't ignore suffering but rejects connection - her core contradiction. The teen girl John Connors force open her guarded heart.In turn, the Spider Girls lacked parental warmth in their biological homes. Long-motherless Cassandra steps in as guardian, filling the void of parental affection. Children find the mother able to nurture them, the motherless child abandons her isolation.From their first encounter, the film quickly establishes quasi-sibling chemistry between the tough protector and her snarky but endearing wards. Julia projects childlike insecurities, Mattie stirs up mischief, Anya tries to avoid trouble. Their clashing personalities bounce off wonderfully.Cassandra schools them in emergency aid and maternal concern, earning awed admiration. Though unrelated, their interactions feel intimate and familial.Effective parallels reinforce the themes: Cassandra's first aid training ultimately saves her, the mother who sacrificed her health for her child echoes Cassandra's injuries protecting the Spider Girls, her climactic embrace of her ""web"" links those she wants to save, representing the end of isolation and connection to humanity.Peter Parker's birth also resonates, the symbolic renewal of this makeshift family.Regrettably, despite its merits, Madame Web suffers under the burdensome legacy of Sony's past Marvel missteps - disjointed editing, chintzy production design, leaden dialogue, choppy scene flow.I don't understand Sony's insistence on retaining this tawdry aesthetic. Whether deliberate or not, they show no desire to improve.Madame Web could have been so much better were it not for these constraining forces constantly dragging it back from the precipice of greatness into the realm of total garbage.That said, the cinematography does show some evolution from the dreary, detail-deprived camerawork of past installments.The soundtrack choice of Cranberries' ""Dreams"" perfectly captures Cassandra's mindset, precognitive powers and optimism in the next generation. ""My life is changing everyday in every possible way."" Did she foresee the way to Madame Web 2 and Sony's commitment to quality? I doubt it."
jasoncrowley-94-18286,2,A pointless filler of a movie,"Why? There was no need for this film to be made, her story could have been a foot note and then concentrate of the origin stories of the three spider women to be. The villain in the film was weak, the action been done before . The thing is I really wanted to like this movie but I feel the timelines been completely messed up. Dakota should have kept to ropes and chains rather than webs and spiders .Definatly a wait till it comes out on tv film luckily I had a pass so didn't have to pay to see it. Hope Kraven the hunter is better but I'm not holding my breath after this and Morbius but fingers crossed."
UniqueParticle,2,Easily the worst marvel movie ever!,"How did this have 5 writers the writing and acting were so bad!?! Saw in imax which didn't help much there's much better in that format. Genuinely expected better cause SJ Clarkson has directed excellent episodes of numerous series like Dexter, Succession and House M. D which I love a lot among other series but Madame Web was so messy. This is unique for me since I usually love everything I watch, I have 2,181 reviews to where I generally praise most things while this has flaws throughout. I should say though the special effects were great, the cinematography was excellent, and a few parts were solid otherwise a hot webbed mess!Come on my review is solid at least."
japongt,5,It was at least better than The Marvels,"But I mean, when that bar is so low, it's not an accomplishment. I wouldn't dare to try to defend this movie. In that respect, I agree with most reviews here, it's pretty bad. But at least I found myself entertained. Had a few funny scenes that actually made me laugh, which is more than I can say for The Marvels or several other terrible MCU movies that have been released recently.That said, hopefully, HOPEFULLY this provides incentives to corporations like Sony, Disney, etc. To just... do better. Focus on quality content, not agenda. Get good writers, not product placement. Just... get it together."
prsnshaun,2,Learn a lesson,Marvel do you never learn.. stick to making your own movies instead of letting Sony ruin them .. this is by far one of the worst superhero movies ever..poor story .. poor acting even the effects aren't that good . Took ages to get going and only the last 10 to 15 minutes are action packed .. this could be a costly mistake for Sony and marvel and does not bode well for kraven the hunter later in the year.. which I was looking forward to but after this monstrosity I might wait for the reviews first .. I do hope we get back to some better superhero movies the last 2 years or so have been so poor up your game marvel ..
frizzardi,7,Actually a 6.5 stars,"I watched this with below-ground expectations, having read the reviews in the IMDB.Actually it's not half bad, definitely not deserving the 3.something score that it currently holds.I was waiting for the messy and incoherent script to materialize, and it never did: if anything, the story is linear and predictable - several other movies dealt with the predestination paradox in a more engaging fashion.I've never read the source material so I cannot say if Dakota does a good job as Madame Web, but her dry wit - particularly the banter with coworker Scott, or the disaster at the baby shower - were rather funny.It's a superhero movie, so don't expect Shakespeare; overall - and I see that I'm going against the mass here - I don't regret the time I spent watching this movie.As a comparison, if I had a time machine - or clarvoyance powers - I would never watch Ant Man 3 or The Marvels again: *those* were movies with incoherent scripts."
rocker_21,2,"SONY, please let go spidey. Please!","Exceed my expectations but in a terrible way.Why Sony, why? Why you choose the same bad writer from Morbius? But this is worse.I just can't believe how everyone approve this movie to the theaters. This is not a single person decision. How bad is this movie???? You will see.Bad writing. ""With great responsibility, great power will come"". Are you serious?????? I wrote bad writing but is also lazy writing. Dialogs are poor, empty and sometimes nonsense. The bad guy is also bad at acting but i must admit that writing was so bad that he perform badly because of that.Dakota must be looking right now for another shot in other movie before it's too late."
wwpdgqdmn,9,Idk why they dont like literally is good movie,"I really liked the movie, the only thing missing was that the powers were not used much and the bad guy's story was not handled very well. The CGI wasn't that bad. I watched it with real excitement and the acting was very good. I didn't understand a single reason why it wasn't liked. They just wanted to criticize it. It was very good. Personally, those who didn't like it were expecting a lot. What needed to be done for a standard movie was done. The movie is definitely worth watching.Madam, the scenes of going back to the past and understanding the power of the web were staged really well. I was very prejudiced about the movie because its IMBD rating was extremely low, but after watching it, I got really close to the characters. Okay, maybe I can accept that some scenes were ridiculous, but that doesn't make the whole movie bad because most of it was pretty good, not even a single scene. It didn't bore me and I am a very bored person."
cowelljeremy,7,Strange Reviews,"I think negativity must be catching. This film was just not that bad. An average MARVEL offering actually. Don't be put off by our negative Nellie's!!! Make your own mind up.William Shakespeare (bapt. Tooltip baptised 26April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the ""Bard of Avon"" (or simply ""the Bard"").

Otkon,3,What a letdown.,"Because it wasn't nearly as campy and inept as everyone is making it out to be. Oh, it's still bad but in a super-dull and exceedingly pointless fashion. I was hoping for Corman's Fantastic Four-levels of corniness and it was just Dakota Johnson mumble-coring and dead-eying her way through meandering scene after scene that had no tension or sense.The whole movie felt like an unaired pilot for a Saturday morning kids' show called Spider Teens Stupid Force. And sadly, the most interesting part was the flashforward stuff with the kids - which is what should have been the real movie. Not EMT call after EMT call after baby shower with Adam Scott. He was bizarrely effective in a straight guy role - very caring and involving while Dakota Johnson was dreaming of Cabo or finally inheriting grandma's big cat rescue or all those Miami Vice residuals from dad.But she looks that disinterested in everything she has ever done, so I guess she was a paramedic.Anyway, it's just boring. I mean, scenes happen. Over and over. Literally. Because of her arachnid powers to endure bad screenwriting? I guess. And that stuff got really old. Quickly. We got it the first twelve times. Too bad it took her way longer to understand what was going on. Yeah, she's that dim.The villain guy was dumb and smarmy. The ending was dragged out and the denouement was setting up a sequel or show that will thankfully never happen. So yay?But shoot. I was hoping for Birdemic cheesiness. And I got Raimi's Spiderman 3 stupidity."
lukusakevin,1,Masterclass of Mediocrity✨,"I found a new reason for watching marvel's movies, they're so bad that it feels like a revolution for mediocrity in Hollywood. I don't think I've ever been more aware of the acting and the production within a movie while watching it. I couldn't even pay attention to the story or the characters. The curtain that separates actors and the characters they play was not even there.Marvel is making us fall out of love with superhero movies, and there's no one else even trying to do better. They don't care about the story, the don't care about the fans. They just wanna make as much money as possible before they lose all the fans."
kylestephenting,1,Good Ol Times,"When I was 12 years old me and my friends would hit each others balls whenever we saw a white car. As you would assume it happened a lot and it wasn't the best time as this lasted for a solid year. Lots of bad memory of talking then being hit in the sack by one of our friend who plays baseball.As I watched this movie last night I recall that memory and have come to the conclusion that this was worse than that experience.As the tone dead actors spit out their cliché dialogues. The camera work didn't fail to amuse us as well. We wanted to leave the theaters but we ended up enjoying the movie by viewing it as a comedy and see how bad it gets worse. Trust me, theres absolutely no redeeming factor in this movie.Bad casting.Bad writing.Bad camera work.Bad audio (this was the first time this has happened)"
Andy-Wheale,1,Interesting marketing strategy,"This is one of those films where its so astronomically bad in every possible way you have to question if it was done deliberately or not.Like, you know things like Sharknado, or Snakes On A Plane! - where the whole thing is quite clearly a ridiculously bad idea and everyone surely must know it, but they make it anyway based on the idea that people will go and and see it in the hopes that its enjoyably bad.You know when you saw Star Wars IX and you kinda hoped it would somehow rescue the mess that is the sequel trilogy, this isn't like that, because with that you expected it to be bad but wanted it to be good.With this, you know its going to be bad, they know its going to be bad, and as such you can hope to enjoy how bad it is, but you cant, because it really is that bad.Once of the worst films ever made."
jboothmillard,3,Madame Web,"I assumed this superhero film was inspired by Spider-Man or Spider-Woman, but I didn't realise it was based on an existing Marvel Comic, I thought trailers for it looked fairly good, so I was kind of surprised to hear it was getting negative feedback from critics, but I was still going to see it. Basically, in 1973, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) and his pregnant partner Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) led a research team through the jungles of Peru. Constance has been searching for and successfully captures an unidentified species of spider with rare healing properties. But Ezekiel betrays the team, shooting them all dead, claims the spider for himself and leaves Constance for dead after shooting her. An indigenous tribe takes Constance to a cave and natural spring hoping to save her, but she dies shortly after giving birth to a daughter who is named Cassandra. In 2003, in Queens, New York, Cassandra, or ""Cassie"" (Dakota Johnson) lives alone and works as a paramedic alongside her co-workers Benjamin ""Ben"" Parker (Adam Scott) and O'Neil (Mike Epps). An emergency sees a driver in his car hanging off a bridge, Cassie saves him but is trapped in the car as it falls into the water. She has a near-death experience and has strange visions before she is revived by Ben. After this accident, Cassie begins experiencing clairvoyant visions which she initially dismisses them as déjà vu. But she is upset when this happens moments before O'Neil is killed when a truck crashes into an ambulance he is inside, she failed to stop him from being killed, and it seems she can see into the future. Meanwhile, Ezekiel has gained similar powers himself along with enhanced physical abilities. For a long time, he has been experiencing nightmares about three young women who he believes are destined to kill him. He collects information and identifies these three young women: Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor). Cassie has coincidentally encountered the same young women herself: Cassie saved Julia's stepmother, she lives in the same building as Anya, and Mattie flipped her off. Whilst travelling from Grand Central Station, all three of them get onto the same train as Cassie, and after a vision, she intervenes to stop Ezekiel from ambushing them. The four of them escape the subway and Cassie steals a taxi, taking the three young women out of the city to hide in the forest. They all realise they are connected but Cassie cannot explain what is happening and why. She leaves them to return to her apartment to look through her late mother's notes. She finds out Ezekiel's identity and the true nature of his powers. Feeling hungry, the girls ignore Cassie's instructions and go to a diner. Hacking CCTV and using face identification software, Ezekiel's research assistant Amaria (Zosia Mamet) locates them, and he makes his way. Cassie arrives back in the forest; she has a vision and stops Ezekiel just in time and saves the girls. She is angry that they did not listen, but she realises they are scared and takes them back to Queens. After reading about her late mother's work, Cassie realises she travelled to Peru; she leaves the girls with Ben to hide out because she needs to find out more about herself. In Peru, Cassie tracks down the tribal chief Santiago (José María Yazpik) who tried to help her mother. Santiago explains that Cassie has other potential abilities she may not realise she is capable of. He puts through a ritual that helps her experience astral projection (separating her soul from her body). She experiences a plane of higher consciousness where all living things are connected and where every possible future can be seen. Using her abilities, she is able to see into the past and learns that her mother wanted the spider to save Cassie from a fatal hereditary disease. Ben's pregnant sister-in-law Mary Parker (Emma Roberts, Julia's niece) is heavily pregnant and needs to go to a hospital when she goes into labour. He is forced to take the girls with him to a hospital. L intercepts them again, but Cassie rescues the girls and distracts Ezekiel so Ben and Mary can get away. Cassie, Julia, Anya, and Mattie lure Ezekiel to a condemned firework factory, setting up traps to disorient him while Cassie calls for a medical evacuation helicopter to fly to their location. Ezekiel destroys the helicopter and separates the girls, then isolates Cassie where he taunts her with her mother's death. By tapping into the Web of Life, Cassie projects herself into three points and helps Mattie, Anya, and Julia to safety. Finally, she sets one last trap for Ezekiel, causing him to fall and he is crushed to death by a falling sign. It is Cassie who was destined to kill Ezekiel, not the girls he assumed from his visions. An ignited firework strikes Cassie in the face, blinding her. Cassie is taken to the hospital while Mary is giving birth to her son. Cassie wakes up blind and finds she is also paralysed from the waist down due to her injuries. However, her connection to the Web of Life means she can see fully into the future. Cassie assures the girls that she will mentor them to become the Spider-Women they are destined to become. Also starring Kathy-Ann Hart as Susan, Josh Drennen as Julia's Dad, and Yuma Feldman as Julia's Half Sibling. Fifty Shades of Grey star Johnson is not the most convincing heroine, Sweeney, Merced and O'Connor are mildly likeable as the trio of victims, and Rahim is a silly villain. It should be mentioned that being set in 2003, I did kind of enjoy the moments of nostalgia throughout the script: Beyoncé's album Dangerously in Love, and the soundtrack including ""Scandalous"" by Mis-Teeq and ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears (it became bigger in 2004). This standalone film has some fairly exciting fights and chase sequences accompanied by mildly impressive special effects CGI; the problem is that it is messy. The script is a bit all over the place with daft dialogue, it just feels cliched and predictable, a clunky and disappointing superhero adventure. Adequate!"
mrhaxhiu-03093,3,What a letdown 🙁,Didn't expect much and still got disappointed. Sony officially reached a new low. I regret paying for this movie. The plot is confusing and i'm not really sure if this is supposed to be a comedy or a real superhero movie.She tries to save that guy from the car and ends up getting traped herself. I really hoped it turns out this js like a big plot twist or something...boy was i disappointed.The spidergirls are women in their 20s playing teens? What the hell is going on. And the ezekiel guy is just annoying and pointless. The guy is like on a acid trip half of the time he is shown. This is really weird and i wish i could take back the 2 hours i wasted on this.
heno-45762,6,Better than what people say,"This is pretty simple. The whole movie is a lot better than what you would expect. I don't know why the rating is so low. Me my family enjoyed it and yes it was a little bit dumbfounded, but at the end of the day it was entertaining. The problem was bad guy was not really that bad, not a good actor at all. Things didn't make sense through the film but what did you expect. The ending fight scene was good, the idea of the movie was great specially the preview of the film. The writing should of been a hell lot better and explained itself more. This film doesn't deserve the 3.7/10 at all. Its worth your time on a rainy day."
Tweetienator,3,No Thanks Madame,"The most surprising fact is that on the script of Madame Web, three (according to IMDb) or four (as per Wiki) writers were involved in getting the job done... I really don't know why you need so much staff for writing such a generic and redundant (and bad) script, but well, hopefully AI will do a better job not too far in the future... Anyway, Madame Web has one problem - everything is just bad or at best average: the story, the action, the production; well, the cast is trying to work with what they've got but that's not too much. Madame Web: a movie for future generations of producers, directors, and writers to study how not to write and make a movie. But well, in the past years, we've had a lot of that kind, haven't we? Verdict: Marvelesque is the new bad, only recommended for those with a strong appetite for schrott and boredom."
jameyedwardsartwork,9,Not exactly sure what people were expecting...,"So, I was definitely hyped to watch this movie and I am familiar with the character ""Madame Web"".So I'm not sure what kind of superhero, people were expecting with all the negative reviews.There was a lot in the movie I didn't expect and it also gave some solid recognition to Spider-Man lore.The movie did not play out like the trailer portrayed and I actually liked that!It was thoughtful, and better than most recent Disney/Marvel movies.Bottom line. Watch it for yourself and see what you think. Don't always believe the masses because most are afraid to go against the ""popular grain""."
Andikalix,6,"Well, The Genre Did Emphasize On Superhero Movie Not Action Movie","Die-hard fans of the existing Spider-Man movies might be surprised by Madame Web's lack of direct connection to established characters. Instead, the film carves its own path within the larger Spider-Man universe. However, eagle-eyed viewers can catch subtle references and nods to the web-slinging hero, creating a sense of connection for those familiar with the franchise. Madame Web steps away from the high-octane action sequences often associated with superhero films. Instead, it focuses on the unique world and abilities of its protagonist. This focus on character development and world-building could be a breath of fresh air for viewers seeking a superhero story with a different pace. It's important to note that Madame Web prioritizes story and character development over fast-paced action sequences. If you're looking for a contemplative film that delves into the psychic aspects of the superhero world, Madame Web might be a good choice. However, if action is a major draw for you in superhero movies, this film might not fulfill those expectations. Consider what you enjoy most in a superhero movie. If you're looking for something unique with a fresh perspective and a focus on character development, Madame Web could be worth checking out. However, if nonstop action is what you crave, this movie might leave you wanting more."
tihoivanov,1,One of the worst superhero movies,"I'm a comic book fan and as such It's rare to miss a movie based on them. Some are good, others are shrill capable of making a constipated person cry. But there are movies like Madame Web that I don't know how to define. There's more emotion in the viewers who are moaning and cursing and hating their lives for being in that exact place at that moment than in the actors. The main character is everything but a hero and the bad guy doesn't even know why he's bad... Even I wore the superhero costumes in the movie more than they did. No one knows what they are doing, just some random people running around in chaos, talking to each other as if they were in a play at a community center in a village of 37 people. The emotion in them is comparable to a person who has been in a coma for five years. If you see this movie somewhere on the net stop your internet connection! If by chance its played on the TV or else, immediately break the device it is running on. If someone forces you to watch them at the cinema, report him for harassment to the authorities."
samjohndrinkwater,1,Worst Marvel Movie ever!,The characters in this movie are all poorly written but the acting is also terrible from EVERYONE. So many plot holes and things that just make absolutely no sense. The powers are apparently different for everyone being bitten by the same spider? I laughed throughout the entire movie in the theaters as this was an entire joke of a movie. At the end they did the power and responsibility line but made it sound so stupid. The Spider-Man getting beaten by fireworks is so dumb. Madam Web somehow knows based on two photographs where her mom was on Peru with no guide or help. The three teen girls never get their powers or fight the entire movie. I can keep going with how many dumb things happen in this stupid movie. This movie is not worth anyone's time.
alizaydan-41062,1,Wasted my time. Avoid watching it at any cost,"I recently had the misfortune of watching Madame Web and I can confidently say it's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The plot was virtually nonexistent, with the story meandering aimlessly from one dull scene to another. The dialogue was painfully awkward, and the characters were so poorly developed that I found it impossible to care about any of them.The acting was abysmal, with performances that ranged from overly melodramatic to completely lifeless. It felt like the cast had been randomly selected from a high school drama class, with no sense of direction or purpose in their roles.The special effects were laughably bad, reminiscent of a low-budget 90s sci-fi TV show. Any attempt at creating suspense or excitement fell flat due to the poor execution and lack of creativity.The soundtrack was equally disappointing, consisting of generic, uninspired music that did nothing to enhance the viewing experience. It was as if the filmmakers couldn't be bothered to invest in a decent score.Overall, it make me feel bad that i wasted my time watching this movie on netflix with my wife, WE COULD HAVE BEEN SLEEPING instead,"
jvormer,4,Someone needs to tell Dakota she can't act.,"Of all the characters to be picked out of the Marvel universe and all the actress in the world. Sony manages to pick the 2 worst.Madame web is a side character, not more interesting than supporting Spiderman or woman. The bizar thing is we taking about spider people now, there goes spiderman his uniqueness. It's a bit too much to translate every Comic book character to the big screen. Especially with the extremely complex back stories.On top of that Dakota Johnson is a very bad actrice, who gets kuddos for the 50 shades franchise.The 3 girls in the movie are portrait shallow and wierd. In the dinner For some reason 3 girls walk up to a table of boys and end up dancing on the table in the dinner. I dont know who wrote that scene but I hope they don't have kids.Upcoming actresses who should have picked another movie.It has its fun moments of visual entertainment besides that it's a hot mess."
jenboswe,1,Did ChatGPT write this?,"It's been a really long time since I've watched a movie that raised my blood pressure. It was an amazing cast, who I honestly feel sorry for. I gave it one star because I like the cast... But easily the worst movie I've seen.Zero character building: Every character was one dimensional; therefore-lacks any sign of inner-relationship chemistry and totally unlikable.Awful dialogue: ""the true film's antagonist"" Left nothing to the imagination, endless audience pandering, and almost all lines were awkward. I will say, this could boost their chances of joining the ranks of cult-following b movie watch parties.. but it's technically not a low budget film. 🤷‍♀️Confusing storyline: I'll be kind to the writers and directors on this film.. I hear that Hollywood has uses these committees that oversees a lot of the direction a movie takes, killing the original vision. So much so, I couldn't tell you the point of this movie other than maybe ""girl power""? The movie moved fast and left a lot of things unexplained.Blatant product placement: I mean..maybe there's a conspiracy I can start ""Sony sold the creative rights of Madam Web to Pepsi and regretted it"". The costume choices for the heroes & villains resemble that of the Pepsi & Coca-Cola rivalry.To sum it up: Spring Cleaning Background Noise."
RegalsReelView,5,Streamable at best,"Orphaned at childbirth, Cassandra Webb grew up to be a socially awkward adult unable to connect with her peers. After a near-death experience at work, Cassey starts to experience visions. When she experiences a vision involving the murder of three teenage girls, she is tangled in a web long in the making.This movie is the latest installment in the Sony Spider-Verse. The movie is more of a mystery than a superhero movie. It is light on action, superpowers, and costumes. The story does a decent job of introducing the character and referencing others. The movie does not refer to other major Marvel movies. Fans of the characters might get frustrated with the way the story unfolds. This is a decent enough movie to stream."
cookharper,7,I didn't look at my watch once!,"I am just going to copy a posting I made on social media, since IMBD want so many characters. Here goes...Am I really going to do this? Madame Web has been brutalized by fans and critics like no film in recent memory. It is down to a 3.7/10 on IMDB, and is described as one of the worst movies ever made. I was discussing this movie with my niece Hunter, and she said she would go watch it just to see how bad it was. Since she put that particular bug into my brain, against all logic I have been searching for a reason to go see Madame Web.I am rarely disappointed by a movie. I usually read tons of user reviews, and have a reasonably good picture of what I am about to walk into. The one recent movie that did disappoint me was Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The first Aquaman movie was so amazing that I didn't follow my normal procedure and went with nothing but the highest expectations, and zero knowledge of the movie or how it had been accepted by movie goers.Well, I sat there in the theatre looking at my watch during most of the movie (I don't even wear a watch), wondering if it was ever going to end so that I could be put out of my misery. As soon as I got home I ran straight for the computer so that I could read the user reviews, and I was not disappointed. Most user reviews seemed to exactly mirror the tragic experience that I had so recently endured. Why did I not check the reviews? It was all there in black and white.My need to see Madame Web has only grown in the intervening days. I have been reading so many news articles in an attempt to find a reason to see it. I have read every positive IMDB review for this movie, and I have all but convinced myself that I am now armed with the knowledge that will allow me to watch this film, and maybe even appreciate and enjoy it. I think I have worked myself up into a frenzied state so that I can go and do something that my rational mind is screaming at me to not do.What really gets me wondering is that Aquaman and the Lost City rates on IMBD at a 5.7/10 compared to Madame Web's 3.7/10. Aquaman was filled with solid actors and amazing CG images, and yet my high expectations left me counting the seconds until it thankfully ended. Going into Madame Web with low expectations may be what saves it for me.I can't help but think about the 2004 movie Van Helsing. I absolutely adore that movie now, but at the time I saw it I was kind of disappointed. The story seemed thin, but the CGI was truly amazing. I told a friend of mine to go see Van Helsing. I told him that it was a monster flick. It didn't have the most convoluted story in the world, but what it did have was a visual feast for the eyes that would amaze him. He saw it, and he absolutely loved it. I hope this will be like that for me!*****
The fallout.*****OK...I went and saw Madame Web, and I am really glad that I did. I really enjoyed it! And guess what? I never looked at my watch once. Unlike Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, I didn't want this movie to end.Madame Web was an entertaining movie, with quite a few funny moments. Even better though was the fact that it was unpredictable. I really enjoy movies where I can't guess what will happen next.The antagonist wasn't really that great. I don't think it was the fault of the actor. I think it was a writer problem that blew up into a bigger issue, and I will leave it at that.I must say that the cool factor of a superhero who has to use her brain power to outwit a much more physically powerful (downright scary!) opponent really appealed to me. It heightened the tension so much. Now, I am super disappointed that the failure of this movie means we probably won't get to see the developed character of Madame Web work her magic against an even more powerful (and hopefully smarter and better written) opponent.Madame Web has rebounded slightly to a 3.8/10 on IMDB, which shows that more people are giving it some love now. Unfortunately, there are just too many nails in that coffin for me to believe that there will be a second Madame Web movie any time soon. Heck, we were the only people in the theatre, so if you wanted to go see it, your days are limited. I really hope that I am wrong. Perhaps Madame Web will show up in a Venom movie in the future. I would love to see that! Brains and brawn working together would be a super cool thing to see.*****
So...there you have it. I wanted to give this a 10/10 just to boost the ratings, but I couldn't. It was far from a perfect movie, but it was entertaining. When I go to see a movie I want to be run through the whole gamut of emotions. I want to be happy, sad, laugh, cry, feel enraged, and be thankful. I am the type of person who wears their heart on their sleeve. I even managed to tear up at one stage, which proves to me that there is hope for this film and its progeny.My recommendation is to go see Madame Web in the theatre. It's never the same watching a movie at home, and you won't get another chance to see this one in theatres."
ima-35332,1,Garbage,"The acting was barely recognizable as acting......
The do lows 1970's soap opera'esk at best.....

He sucked so bad.........The production was at best, on the level of a b-rate adult film........Special effects, fair to midland........Did they have to rewrite most of this, it seems like they needed to, or should have........The best thkng to do for this movie is to scrape it from all existence and make it again with good actors an actual director and maybe find someone that knows how to produce a movie.......It took the days to get through this... Fell asleep 4 times...."
joseph-boik,8,Definitely not the worst Marvel movie,"This is not Spider-Man. This is not Avengers. This is Madame Web. And it was an enjoyable film of the Marvel Universe.The worst areas of this movie is some of the early CG, but it's made up by Dakota Johnson's portrayal and her onscreen chemistry with Adam Scott, as well as the young teenagers. This is very much an origin story of Cassie Webb confronting her own past to understand what she's destined for and with Madame Web it's filled with mystery and time. Visuals from Madame Web's perspective were twisting and confusing with intention, which I felt was appropriate and engaging.It's a fun movie, and while it may not revolutionize the film industry or call upon the likes of Steve Rogers or Thor for another explosive epic like the Infinity Saga, it does set up for some important arcs in the future. For an origin story that I didn't expect or even think was necessary, I truly had fun watching this one, and I'd recommend it to people that want to just shut off and watch something, and I'd watch it again.Honestly, people calling this the worst Marvel film, or for some the worst film in history are overdramatizing their own, or possibly someone else's criticism that they are shadowing. If you read the bad reviews and believe them, chances are you're already in a negative mindset going in yourself.My recommendation: stop reading these reviews believing the opinions of others who claim to know better and trust your own judgement. My rating is my rating."
roberttole,6,There are worse movies!,"I've seen worse movies than this, Morbius was worse imo. Many superhero movies like the recent Fantastic 4 and any of the Ghostriders movies were a whole lot worse. Sure script and CGI could have been better but the movie was more of a horror movie with it's typical cliches. Story wise it was ok and I was quiet entertaining.I enjoyed the early 2000s nostalgia, there was a lot of soundtracks of hit musics of that time. It's not a superhero film sure, like I mentioned it was more of a thriller mixed with a prequel to a superhero movie. Villian could have been better but they tried, I guess. Overall I was satisfied."
mrdupondishere-53470,1,Stop making W O K E films with characters no one cares about,The plot was horrid and the characters were unconvincing. Their stories didn't even make sense and it's obvious that you just wanted to make some kind of girl power film AGAIN and force feed the 'message' down consumers throats.Who is Madame Web even? A character from the comics that you just changed and changed everyone as you always do.Everyone is sick of you force feeding us these narratives in all of your films. You used to be such a magical company with a treasure trove of IP's that you've slowly been destroying.Abandon the MCU and explore the XMEN universe movie by movie for each X-men character. FIRE EVERY W O K E person that works there who will be an activist before a creator.
billykane-90339,1,This is the worse thing I have seen in years,"The movie started very slow one hour in and I was like what is this, why am I here? To be fair it's an introduction to a new cast and character.The plot is hollow, they should have just animated some back story, show it on tv develop it more on the big screen.This is so disappointing. The dialogue was bad, the joke bad, the action was a bunch of twitchy cam that would make you puke. I don't know what happen to the writers, but it's cringing at time. The cast is beautiful but zero chemistry. Very bland. Probably over paid.I don't recommend this to anyone. Save yourself. Don't watch this horrible movie."
sadfjlfdo24,1,This is insane.,"So I'll start off by saying that I am, in fact, a NYC paramedic. It is always fun to see a writer/director/fluffer on set slap an EMT-Basic patch on a 'medic' in movies and then have those medics respond to car wrecks.Newsflash, amateurs - medics don't respond to car crashes or wear those ugly patches or wear them on the wrong side. I mean did you even see an FDNY ambulance, ever? You also got the wrong type of ambulances. I mean the whole thing is just offensive if it wasn't so amateurish. Also no bunker gear while crawling through a car? Yeah, you literally have no idea what you doing.Second part that really got me was the whole NSA thing. You guys are really, really.. really.. REALLY.. bad/lazy writers.Lastly the directing/ camera work/ exposition/ character development.. its just bad. I've seen NYU film majors make better movies, and they really suck at this.So in conclusion.. I'm annoyed. I've sat through the first half of the movie literally facepalming, and second half just trying my best to suspend the disbelief, but its just not working. Someone needs to pay for this incompetence."
dreamdemon-1,1,No redeeming qualities to be found,"I get it. We definitely need some strong female action figures.However, the laziness of saying ""let's do a female Iron Man, or a female Spiderman or whatnot"" is totally countrerproductive here, particularly in a world where superhero fatigue has taken hold.The MCU has not only raised the bar on the expectations moviegoers have about superhero movies but it has also oversatisfied the demand to the point few (if any) would actively demand more superhero movies.Sure, we're poised to consume some that come out but to leave a mark a movie needs to provide a strong story, at least above average acting and at least on-par VFX. There's really no margin for laziness here because any follow-up act has its work cut out for itself if it wants to make an impact. Doubly so when female leads are front and center (largely due to previous laziness as seen in the latest Ghostbusters installment)
But ""Madame Web"" makes no effort whatsoever. It's formulaic, lazy, beyond silly. The leads definitely have a hard time turning an awful script into an opportunity and there's just no room for them to ... you know ... act. It's a total waste of their talents to the point where I'm baffled that nobody threw the script away and ran screaming.At what point is a paycheck too little for a stain on your career? I can't directly blame them though, but I'm sure there are people in an office somewhere in Hollywood who'll land the blame on people not wanting strong female action leads."
aditya-12689,1,Never Seen a Movie as bad as this,"A Painful Experience with Madem Web: A Disaster in Every Aspect.I recently subjected myself to the excruciating torture of watching Madem Web, and I must say it was an absolute disaster from start to finish. The creators of this web movie seems to have mastered the art of making every possible wrong decision, leaving viewers with an unbearable viewing experience.To begin with, the plot was an incoherent mess. It felt like the writers threw random ideas into a blender and presented the resulting concoction as a storyline. There was a complete lack of character development, leaving the audience struggling to connect with anyone on screen. The dialogues were cringe-worthy, filled with clichés and uninspired lines that made me question the competence of the writing team.The production quality was abysmal, to say the least. The cinematography was amateurish, with shaky camera work and poorly framed shots that induced headaches rather than conveying any artistic value. The special effects were laughable, resembling something out of a low-budget student film rather than a professional production.The acting was another painful aspect of Madem Web. It seemed like the cast was either sleepwalking through their roles or desperately trying to salvage a sinking ship. The lack of chemistry between characters was palpable, and the performances were so wooden that it made me cringe every time someone delivered a line.The pacing was torturously slow, with seemingly endless scenes that added nothing to the nonexistent plot. I found myself constantly checking the time, hoping for the misery to end. The attempts at creating suspense were laughable, as the predictable plot twists were telegraphed from miles away.In conclusion, Madem Web is a prime example of how not to create a web series. It was a painful and torturous experience that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. Save yourself the agony and avoid this train wreck at all costs. There are countless other quality productions out there deserving of your time and attention."
scott-a-johnson,1,"Hard, hard pass","You're familiar with Certified Fresh/Rotten for movies that are awesome/blow; thank you Sony for giving us a new verb for movie rating scales: Madame Web. ""Hey Johnny, did you see that new action flick last night? Naw was it good? Not even; it got Madame Web'd!""Previously my yardstick for every bad movie since 2003 was ""The Core"". Now, it's Madame Web. The plot was *horrible*. The acting was sub par and lacked any depth (I really do mean any depth). The villain was full of C-level comic book cliches and bad tropes. I honestly think of athletes foot as more scary than the antagonist.For even a comic book film, the continuity of the story line and characters was really, really difficult to follow.They appear to have done a significant amount of revising of script in post, as there were several scenes where the actors lips were nowhere in sync with their auditable dialog. This happens in many films, but it was as if I was watching a Japanese anime the sync issues were that apparent.There was not a single redeeming quality to the movie. Marvel should be so embarrassed they're listed as ""in association with"" on this piece of cinema that they invoke the morals clause and ask to be disassociated with the film. Honestly, if I had to choose between watching Web again vs a two hour flick of Howard the Duck sitting on the toilet and having a bowel movement, I wouldn't even have to think about it: Howard and I are about to become good, good friends."
Phil-King-1967,6,Is it because the main characters are Women or the Spider-Man is NOT in this??,"Why are people rating this 1??? Have they only ever seen 2 movies in their life? The production, music and acting deserves a point each at least surely??I have rated home made zombie movvies higher than 1, if you think this is a 1, 2 or even 3 then you need to close your account as you do not belong on a movie site.This is part of Marvel and not just made up charcters. But it looks like it won't be part of the movie Marvel Universe. It looked like it may have been planned to do more movies of this as there is quite big stories in the comics, however, I think this would of happened only if it had done well at the box office...which would of been fine by me.I suspect though that this like Venom and Morbius it was made partly because Sony needs to release Spider-Man related movies to keep hold of the franchise.Anyway, ignore the trolls as I think at worst this is a 5 rated movie. But I gave it a clear 6 and would happily watch a sequel. For me to rate anything 1 it would have sound bad enough not to hear half of it, a stupid script, very bad actors, hearing the director in the background, dreadful/annoying music, actors forgetting their lines ETC.Enjoy."
albertdumitrescu,1,Sony please sell to Marvel,"The worst movie from Spiderverse ever. I am sorry for this review but need to stop this massacre. Sony is going from bad to very bad. They don't have people who have spouses to test their first reaction on how will be received. Let's hope Kraven the Hunter will be on the next level and will save Sony from disaster.Spider-Man Miles Morales will stay alive at the moment Sony but if don't make the minimum of 2 good movies will be buried all Spider-Verse.Let's hope I will not lose again 2 hours of my life to movies like that.Long live the multiverse and Marvel Jesus Deadpool 😂, it is our only hope 🙏"
chappaai-836-114963,7,This film is genreless,"This is a heart warming story, a detailed origin story for a team of will-be superheroes, focusing on how they BEGIN to form their bond.The problem: it didn't get to the part where the protagonists formally become superheroes, or even comrades. By the end of the movie, 3 out of the 4 protagonists are yet to acquire super power, and the one did get to master her power is yet to start fighting crime. They just became friends by saving each other's life, and the only practical thing those kids have learned from the Madam is how to do CPR. This film therefore fails to meet the expectation of superhero movie fans, or even the definition of the superhero genre. As for viewers who are not superhero fans, it wouldn't make sense to watch a film with superpowers.Plenty of people would love this film. It is a down-to-earth story about caring and sticking together. However, without belonging to a genre, there lacks a way for this film to find them. What a shame that this isn't the first few episodes of a superhero TV series."
jennigraham,2,Sony...just STOP,"What a bloody waste of time. Whoever greenlit this monstrosity and allowed it to be released should be fired.Poor plotting, bad writing, terrible cinematography, horribly bad ADR, and (with the exception of Adam Scott), every single person in this movie acts like they'd rather be having major surgery rather than participate in this film.I'm actually embarrassed for every single person involved in this project. No wonder Dakota Johnson switched agencies.Sony, you're losing money on Spider-Man because you don't know what the F to do with it. Sell it back to Marvel, stop humiliating yourselves and cut your losses."
sbmwydfb,1,CIA agents now use this movie to torture inmates,"Ever thought of committing a crime? Don't, because you will be shown this movie until you decide to waterboard yourself. Inmates no longer are sentenced to life in prison but to life watching this dumpster fire.Teens are now using this movie as a new way to self harm.This is why aliens have been avoiding Earth for so longThe U. S. cares more about banning Kinder Eggs than protecting the people from being agonized.It was dark and there was no one in the movie theater. At any moment I thought I'd be trapped and tied to my seat. And be forced to watch this movie for more than the ten minutes I stayed in the theaters.Stay safe and stay healthy."
rajdeepchanda-60400,1,Don't waste your time and money.,"As a film aficionado, it's my duty to caution fellow movie enthusiasts about the abysmal disaster that is the Madame Web movie. This cinematic catastrophe is a prime example of how not to adapt a beloved character to the silver screen. From the laughable special effects that seem straight out of a low-budget '90s TV show to the cringe-inducing dialogue that feels like it was written by a middle-schooler, Madame Web fails on every conceivable level. The plot is as thin as tissue paper, meandering aimlessly through a series of nonsensical scenes that leave viewers scratching their heads in bewilderment. The acting is so wooden and lifeless that even the most seasoned thespians would struggle to salvage this train wreck of a film. Save yourself the agony and avoid Madame Web like the plague. It's an insult to the intelligence of audiences everywhere."
john-lancia-1,1,Nepo Babies and Side Characters,"I'm done with watching the kind of good looking, kind of talented children or good looking and talented people getting careers handed to them just because of who their parents are.Sure, some of them turn out to be actually talented and worthy of the career that some people strive their entire lives for and never achieve. But for the most part, it just means a lot of half assed movies with half assed performances from people who's last names I recognize.If Hollywood keeps this up, they should get used to diminishing returns on their big budget blockbusters.As for movies, especially super hero movies revolving around characters who took up a couple of panels in a couple of obsure comic books. I was never into it. I don't want to watch a bunch of people who did something before Peter Parker was born, I want to watch Peter Parker be Spiderman. I don't want to watch movies revolving around villains that portray them as heros. I want to watch them be bad guys. Bad guys fighting the actual super hero. Not some person in a bad costume with no back story doing something that Peter Parker should be travelling through time to do.Get your act together Hollywood."
thelexmartin,3,Could have been good,The dialog was not cohesive and felt like it was written by a robot. The story line was very interesting and would have been a great movie if they cared more about the script. It would have been useful to have more backstory and payed more attention to the spider people. The ending was trash. It felt forced and did not flow or follow Cassie's narrative. Why did she become a robot acting lady who speaks in riddles. She had such good character development then it was just like cut off and made awkward trying to be all allusive. I feel like they sabotaged the movie so they don't have to make more of them. So disappointing of Sony. I expected more. Loved Dakota though.
arginnon,5,The best kind of bad,"Morbius failed to live up to the hype. Madame Web did not. While the former was simply boring, the latter really is a special kind of bad. Other movies only aspire to achieve something like this but this film pulls of being bad with finesse. And for someone who enjoys bad movies as much as I do, this film is an absolute treat.The production value and the VFX is great which make the bad parts stand out even more. Especially the unashamed product placement, which is so in your face that I couldn't help but laugh out loud in the theater. I mean... a giant-ass Pepsi sign defeats the main villain in the end. It's truly a sight to see.The story is an underdeveloped mess but the actors do their best to take it seriously, which makes it even funnier. Nothing makes sense, the motivations are lackluster but the best thing is probably how everyone has just a single defining trait: ""that girl likes math. You know she likes math, because it's written on her T-Shirt, she solves sudoku puzzles in her free time, always talks about sciency stuff and they even mention it a couple of times that she likes math.""There really isn't another movie as entertainingly bad as this one. Other bad movies are mostly only boring or infuriating but this is so much fun.Don't get me wrong, it is bad. I, for example hated the fact that it mascaraded as a feminist film for having female leads, but constantly made eye-candies of the minors, and it had some pretty apparent anti-choice propaganda as its main theme. So yeah, I struggled a lot with rating this film: I didn't want to give it a low rating, because it was very entertaining for me but I didn't want to give it a high rating either because it was bad. And even though it was anything but mid, I finally decided to give it something inbetween."
stop_thebeat,7,Spider fam,"I stupidly listened to the hate hype about this film before deciding one rainy day to give it a chance and form my own opinion.Glad I did, it was a fun, entertaining addition to the 'Spider-verse'
The characters were endearing and well rounded, admittedly if you went into this without knowing the basics of the Spiderman family unit you may have been a little lost.The effects were good, loved the soundtrack and as this was set in the past it was fun to know where they'd inevitably end up.The girls were all well acted, felt like a prequel to Charlie's angels at times (not in a bad way, #girlpower)
Really liked the Villian, tortured by his future driven mad by it rational thought escaped him and obsession took over. It was very well portrayed & I'd quite like to see him again.Interestingly this film features birth of Peter Parker, but which version? Maybe a new one yet to be cast. Whether this film is set in the 'Venom-verse' remains to be seen. But is sure enjoy a sequel. I really hope people give this a chance before jumping on the 'female hate train' for me Madame Web spun a surprisingly entertaining adventure with a superpower we've not seen before."
lbz_1979,1,"The same writers wrote ""Morbius"", ""Gods of Egypt"", and ""Last Witch Hunter."" Who hires these hacks?",These writers have now written four of the worst movies if the last ten years. They should be blacklisted from Hollywood as should those who hired these buffoons.Dakota Johnson is the worst of the Nepo babies. How did Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith produce a kid with no discernible talent? She is more wooden than Pinocchio and below average in looks. There are so many struggling actresses with actual talent that will never get a chance because of people like her.This makes Daredevil look like Top Gun: Maverick. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this in the theater unless they brought in a 12 pack of Modelo with them. There's no way someone should watch this sober.
tylerch44,8,Better than expected,"I'll admit there are some issues with Madame Web, mainly that the big threat the villain comes to chase down, doesn't exist. We see glimpses of what the powers -can - and - will- be, but we don't see any useful scenes of teamwork battling with said powers to bring the film together. I'm almost certain this was an attempt to create a new spider-verse with four new stars. Dakota Johnson did a really fine job in this role, and quite possibly this might be the best role I've seen her in, comical but serious, without being cliche. The villain constantly cries ""they'll destroy everything I have"" but we never learn what he has that they'll destroy. Did he build a company off the spider's venom? Did he amass his wealth by spider-stealing it? There are without a doubt a few issues with the film but the review bombing seems more of a coordinated attack on the film an actors by purists and misogynists who didn't think this film should have been made at all. I do hope they continue this story, but with the ratings as is, I doubt we'll see a follow-up where we see the women actually thrive as super heroes."
chrisgavidia,6,This was not a terrible movie. Entertaining enough if open minded,"This movie really doesn't deserve the hate its getting. Its a passable entertaining enough film. I actually appreciated that it was a little more grounded and not a CGI splat fest. Now there were some problems with the movie and bad dialogue but the film overall was entertaining. It for sure centers more on a female perspective then a male one. I would say this one was ahead of Morbius and Venom 2 for me. Also more bearable then The Marvels which really jumped the shark with the cats in the space station.Don't go in expecting a bunch of heros running around in costumes. Theres been far far worse comic book movies like The Fantastic Four films, The Marvels, IronMan 3 etc."
fartech,1,3.8/10 is too generous,"The entire movie is a clickbait. The entire movie is a 2h ""trailer"" for the ""real movie"" that is supposed to be the 2nd film of this ""franchise"". If I go to see a superhero movie, I expect to see a superhero in action, not 3 ""normal humans"" running away from the villain for 2h straight. The actor who plays the villain cannot speak english well and his lines are dubbed out of sync with the movement of his lips. An episode of PowerPuffGirls would be more satisfying than wasting 2h of your life watching this. I really hoped for this to turn out as at least a mediocre movie but strongly regretted wasting 2h of my life for it."
vzudjoef,3,ITS JUST BAD AS THEY SAID,"Initially, I was skeptical about the early reviews claiming that this film was terrible, even though I could see from the trailers that it didn't look promising. But it turns out, the film is indeed that bad. I agree with the sentiments of others who've said things like ""Morbius is better"" or ""This is one of the worst superhero movies.""Firstly, the story and plot, while generally okay (not terrible), are riddled with plot holes and contrived storytelling that just don't make sense, even within the context of fiction. The narrative is mediocre at best but executed terribly.Then there's the characterization. While these characters are based on comic book characters, they should still have a clear ""why"" for being in the film. Unfortunately, ""Madame Web"" lacks clarity in this aspect. The main character's (Madame Web) existence is justified by an unclear plot device of ""destiny and bestowed power."" The three female characters who are supposed to become Spider-Women lack convincing reasons for their presence in the story other than the villain having visions (there's no further explanation for these visions or why they exist beyond a vague ""curse""). As for the villain, it's typical for superhero films to overlook villain development, but this one is particularly bad. There's no explanation for the villain's initial motive, identity, or how they acquired their powers. Even with the villain's significant powers, it's odd that there's no backstory whatsoever (aside from a brief mention of betraying the main character's mother, which lacks context).Regarding the dialogue, it's a mixed bag for me. Perhaps it's because the language is different from mine, but I felt the dialogue wasn't as strong as in other films considered good. This might be due to the forced nature of the script to keep the plot moving forward.Lastly, the cinematography. It's not necessarily bad, but it's not impressive either. There are a lot of unnecessary zoom in/zoom out shots, and the CGI falls short.Honestly, I hoped I was wrong about this film (I rated it well below 5/10), and I searched for positive reviews from others (on IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, even TikTok), but those who claimed the film was good simply said they enjoyed it without providing any substantial reasons. Enjoyment is subjective, and while a friend of mine said they found the film okay, no one has convinced me that this film is better than I (and many others) thought.Now, I'm concerned about Sony's next film, ""Kraven the Hunter,"" because starting from ""Venom,"" ""Venom 2,"" ""Morbius,"" and now ""Madame Web,"" Sony seems to be diminishing the quality of their films. I'm very worried about ""Kraven the Hunter"" (in fact, I might not even have any expectations for it anymore, like many others)."
BigOlBowser,1,A total casserole of nonsense,"Now, I did go into this reading the reviews and seeing some of the excellent memes... But I honestly wasn't prepared for the sheer awfulness of this movie. It manages to have literally no redeeming features... Not one!The story is both convoluted and mind blowingly boring. The characters (Dakota Johnson in particular) are excruciatingly wooden and just unlikeable, and the dialogue.... Oh my word the dialogue. ""You're the Madame of this web. You are Madame Web"". THIS LINE WAS ACTUALLY SAID! I actually burst out laughing at this point, which I don't think what the actors or director were intending. Also, the main villain is killed by a falling Pepsi sign.... I mean come on....And I have to mention the editing and production values on this film. I checked the credits and there was an editor & team (!!!) for script continuity... but you wouldn't believe it. Case in point, Web looks to rescue someone from a car falling off a bridge near the start of the film (before realising she has powers), only for her one minute to be outside of it, and the next (during virtually the same breadth), to be inside it and upside down??! And oddly, the car was comically massive.... And it's like this throughout. Scenes (especially the ones with 'action) seem thrown together with little thought to what the script dictated was going on. You'll find yourself asking why characters move about all over the place depending on the camera angle, and struggle to follow the poorly directed action, all of which just becomes very staged and samey.But looking beyond the garbage on screen, this film poses a much bigger problem - and that's 'Who's it for?' It's certainly not aimed at comic book fans (of which I count myself) as it totally disposes of the source material. It's not aimed at men (which I am also, too. Sorry.), as any male characters are either evil or passive idiots. And, from what I can see, I really don't think it's aimed at women either, because, aside from having a largely female cast and writing / directing crew, it literally has nothing relatable that I believe women could engage with - I could be wrong, but... really???The only way this film could have been redeemed was if it was played for laughs. The producers must at some point realised they had a total dud on their hands, but continued regardless (with the results being pretty obvious). With a competent director and perhaps better screenwriters, this could have been easily re-tooled as a fourth-wall breaking comedy that revelled in its own ridiculousness. Now that would have been something different and potentially very entertaining.What we got, however, is a film which presents itself as 'serious', yet fails to deliver on any measurable metric whatsoever. Don't waste your money like I did. Just avoid it."
kenyonbarker-07565,1,This movie was a mistake!!!!,"This has to be one of the worst superhero movies I have ever seen!!, I would even go as far as to say it's in the worst movies ever made. I love superhero movies and this felt like it was everything but that. They squandered the talents a very talented actresses with a terrible script and awful editing. The villain in every other character and it feels like it was written by AI. The dialogue was awful, the whole movie felt like some stupid dream. There is more action in the trailer than there was in the movie in every second of CGI was some of the worst I've ever seen, it was a waste of my money please don't let it be a waste of yours.. 0/10🤡"
leolinn,1,Biggest mistake 😔,"""Could someone please explain how it's possible to print and distribute the Daily Bugle across the country in a single afternoon, while also detailing how the kids were kidnapped on the same day?"" Is this a joke could url at least use a cellphone photo to give the location of the kids in the dinner just to make it seem less stupid .""I believe this entire movie was a flop right from the start. You should have taken more time to rethink the story. And the worst part? The camera work was atrocious; it kept jumping all over the place, making it impossible to focus on anything happening. It felt like a child was filming the entire time."""
chrislopez-43933,1,An embarrassment to the art of film making,"I'm sorry but if anyone actually enjoyed this movie or thought it was good you should be drug tested. This is not even one of those ""shut off your brain and enjoy dumb fun movies"" as people like to say. This movie is an absolute slap in the face to the film industry and all the great writers and directors that actually have talent and have given us good to amazing films to watch. Sony is absolutely pathetic and is hurting the comic book movie genre by continuing to release movies about characters no one cares about. So do yourself a favor, spend your money on something else, go out to dinner instead or buy some groceries."
iijpcaus,7,2024film-011(3/10/2024),"2024film-011(3/10/2024)
It seems to be harshly criticized by the public, but it wasn't as bad as the criticism suggests. However, it's also true that it wasn't incredibly interesting either. From my perspective, it felt like the plot was too conveniently set up in favor of the villains. I think about half of the critics are just going along with the general trend and criticizing it without much thought, so I hope those who are interested will watch it without too much prejudice. The ending suggested that there could be a sequel, but given the current reception, I'm a bit saddened by the thought that a continuation might be unlikely."
banzoozalreviews,5,Serviceable superhero affair with a Terminator twist.,"Madame Web is not as bad as everyone is claiming it to be. People were ready to criticize it long before the release, and this movie has been torn apart by critics and audiences alike. It's far from perfect, but it certainly doesn't deserve a 17% Rotten Tomatoes rating. It exudes a very '90s thriller vibe with an extra helping of cheese and corniness-it's essentially a superhero movie with a Terminator twist, an aspect that I loved. Dakota Johnson is solid and likable, as is the rest of the cast. It may not reach the heights of superhero movie greatness, but it's definitely better than Thor: Love and Thunder, Venom 2, Echo, and a few other recent superhero offerings. It may be haphazardly put together, a little insipid here and there, it may be cheesy and corny, but it's definitely not the worst movie ever made, as everyone is touting it to be."
foltyn-tomas,8,No Regrets,"Hi, by my opinion this film is worthy to watch. It has heart and chemistry that is important. Good story, good figure of villain :-))). In this case I am happy that bad ratings have not stopped me to watch it. Dakota play this very charming way and her ladies are also sweet. I am not comics geek or reader so I understand if many fans have their negative critic opinions for taking this light-weighted way. Special effects and music are very good and I have to mention this on margin to nowadays action and other genre movies that in this movie it is not needlessly overdone. And no, ""5 shades of grey"" is not my top movie I have ever seen :-).Thanks."
zconkerite,6,I dig the premise...,"The actors in this movie have credits galore but the question I have is why did they accept this job? It needs a better director and better writer. With a cast this accomplished, it's a darn shame that it comes off as amateurish as it does. Ouch! I blame the director and writer for allowing such banal dialogue and boring delivery. I just wish it could have been up to par with all of the other Marvel movies. It just is not. What a shame. Dakota is a good actress. She is no child nor is she new to acting. Maybe she will leave this movie credit off of her resume. It is a job and will support her pension for a good retirement."
simrok,2,It can't get much worse,"I expected this movie to be bad, and it was somehow worse than i imagined. The writing in this movie is so bad, and it's probably the worst i've seen. The cast is pretty decent, bit they all seem to have gotten the worst script, which you can see gets really hard to deliver. It made every actor in this movie look terrible, and i can't fathom why they all signed up for this.Their whole marketing strategy for this movie was simply, Sydney Sweeney, which also played a questionable role in this movie.You go into this movie thinking you're gonna watch a ""superhero"" movie, but this is far from it. This is just a movie about a girl who sees into the future 3-4 times during the movie, and runs away from a terrible villain. You get to see them all in costumes for 10s at the end of the movie, and that's it.The villain is terrible in this movie, he's literally struggling to get a hold of what's supposed to be 3 teenage girls, which makes no sense at all. Every fighting scene is just him being a complete idiot.Lastly, the voiceover in this movie is makes it seem like it is a dubbed foreign film. None of the words match up with their lips, and it all sounds tame and boring. This is mostly noticable on the villain, Ezekiel (Tahar Rahim). Now i've personally not seen much of him in any other movie, so when i saw this film i genuinly thought he was a non-english speaker with a voiceover from another person, THAT'S how bad it is. Turns out i was wrong, and in a strange way i felt lied to? From his movements and lips, it looks like he's talking in a whole different language, cause it doesn't match up at all.Other things are bad product placements, useless characters, terrible audio, awful plot and so on.Even with all this, it's still a somewhat watchable movie, and it was still a fun watch in it's own way. In no way, does it deserve credit for that."
javiergarcon,3,Why? I tried so hard to love this.,"No matter how hard I tried to love this movie it just didnt catch on. This felt like a Charlies Angel reboot with superpowers. I am sorry, but this is Marvel, not any other type of movie mix that can walk into Marvel... Not acceptable. Just because the greatest creator of our time, Stan Lee, died doesn't mean you can do whatever you want with his comic books. Seriously, you do not have free reign over this and whatever else just because he isn't around anymore. I am ashamed of this movie and any movie to come if this persists! Stan Lee knows that his films were left in good hands! He left it to the public to make sure that we would comment with great disgust and cancel every writer that ever gets close to destroying his work of art! I hope that anyone who ever touches on his work and changes it will never work in Hollywood again to teach them, and anyone who changes his comic books will learn a lifelong lesson! You dont mess with Stan Lee's fans! Seriously we indeed are hardcore fans, and we do not like it when people like this try to change Stan Lee's vision. I expect this type of writing to happen in the DC universe but not in the Marvel. Once again, the only people I give three stars are the sound technicians who work hard to make the background unforgettable! The lighting technicians! The producers do not come cheap! And at the end of this, I thank all the background actors who did a great job."
onstenisadora,1,What did I just watch,"This movie didn't make sense. So irritating to watch for the eyes, came angles and work was terrible with random close up shots and quick changes. The actresses were so bad, it felt as is they were reading from a script. The villian was terrible, it sounded like he's voice was dubbed and it often wasn't syncronized with how his mouth moved... WHAT.Some scenes were cool and effects were good but in general the movie didn't have a good thread of action and things didn't come together well. Many unnecessary parts that were added just to make the movie long enough.I would not recommend watching this at all, I'm so disapointed :("
alexiskp-01704,5,Who wrote this?!,"So much potential if the writing wasn't so bad! These actresses are all super talented and did their best with this terrible script. You had no time to really connect to any of the characters and If anyone would have died I honestly done think I would have been to upset. The villain was cheesy and I honestly can't remember what his goal was other than to survive. The backstories for the girls were boring and lazily written, and Dakota's character was super surface level. The ending was supposed to be a cute and sincere but it was just bad. We wanted girls kicking ass and we got little to none of it. Also the product placement was a joke."
bob_james9397,5,There's a lot of angry people reviewing this movie?,"It's kind of frustrating and funny at the same time. All these people give 1s and 2s. I just see them as living in someone's basement in front of a computer and a half eaten bowl of popcorn by their bed. Maybe that's me. This definitely wasn't a great movie, but it also wasn't a horrible movie. I'm not really sure why people are giving it a 1 and a 2. I can understand maybe a 4. If you're really into Spiderman maybe people thought that it was trying to copy Spiderman, but it really wasn't directly. It just seems like people are dealing in absolutes these days. It's just there are movies either gonna be a 10 or 1. There's no in between. And that's where this movie is. It's definitely in between."
rjvc-78296,5,"Not great, but not bad","I think a lot of the hate around this movie is just hating to hate. It's trendy to hate on things today. That being said, this movie would have benefited from two things: character and plot development. I was pleasantly surprised with the actresses, but none of them had a real story. I was rooting for them because the movie told me to, not because I actually like them or their personalities. Then we had the villain. His death was anticlimactic because he wasn't developed enough. I didn't hate him enough. Yeah, he just killed people, but we never knew why or what his full motivations were. So when he died, it felt super anticlimactic. The plot development was also lacking. Someone else mentioned it but Johnson's character had a way of being very good at being in the right place at the right time (even without the ability to see the future) - at one point jetting off to Peru for what seemed like maybe two days and coming back right as the other characters needed her. It felt like at every turn, I wanted to know more and there were constant unanswered questions.Finally, this is a prequel where we were not invested in the characters at all - which is a miss. If this had the benefit of being in the Disney/Marvel universe, we would have gotten to see the girls as adults in another movie and perhaps get to know their personalities. This would have made getting to know them more fun and engaging - but also would have required this movie to have significantly more character development. Unfortunately, we didn't get any buildup or prior exposure to these characters or their story. All of this being said, the acting was fine, effects were fine, and the baseline plot made enough sense that the movie wasn't flat out unwatchable. So I give it a 5. I could sit through this movie, it just wasn't better than average."
richardfisk,7,Just harsh critics,I enjoyed this movie. It captured a nice essence of Madame Web as intended in the comics.I almost think viewers are too spoiled to appreciate this kind of storytelling. Should Sony stop with the Spiderverse? I don't think so. They've built a nice base to have characters flown into the Spidey-stories. Preferably not all at once. But The critics spoke loud. This will go down as a cult classic and I will be a cult member.The story might have gaps but I didn't experience them. The story might have an inconsistency but that is what possible scenario's will do to your brain. I applaud miss Clarkson for the effort to tell an intelligent story.How much I want to explain to the burners how wrong they are in their judgment. I just don't want to spoil anything.
raquel-39444,8,Why are you guys hating?,"This movie was good. It's not going to win an Oscar but come on! It's a Marvel Movie for Pete sake!! (Ha Pete!).... I enjoyed the story, I loved the characters and Dakota Johnson is great! From Fifty shades to Suspiria, I am a fan. If you are not a Marvel fan don't watch the movie. STOP being a HATER! I hope that they can connect Madame Web with the rest of the spider-verses further and we could see all the Spidermen, Venom and Madame Web in a fantastic combo against the bad guys! That's right that's why you watch comic book movies to enjoy them and have fun...not dissect them into pieces to figure out why it's not Shakespeare."
mlk18,6,Opinions are like... well you know.,"So right now Madame Web is sitting at a 3.8 IMDB rating while The Marvels sits at a 5.6. Both are diverse female lead superhero movies with pretty high budgets and lots of marketing. Madame Web was an okay movie, pretty much what I expected from the trailer and knowing Sony was in charge of making it. Was it a blockbuster thrill ride? Nope. But nothing about this movie made it worthy of a sub 5.0 rating, outside of it being part of the same boring nothing new, nothing amazing, and nothing unexpected world that Hollywood has become. It was good enough to keep me watching and not wish I was somewhere else, like The Marvels did. The Marvels was messy, discombobulated, boring crap-fest that was full of tired old tropes and gimmicks that Marvel somehow still thinks are entertaining. The acting was actually as bad in the writing, and that's saying something. The Marvels was not worthy of a 3.6 let alone a 5.6. All this just goes to show how the average person is willing to embrace mediocrity and celebrate the unexceptional as long as enough people on social media tell them how to think one way or the other. It seems Disney had more money to pay influencers than Sony did. If only these ratings could be about the quality of the movie rather than the marketing. As they say, opinions are like..."
stewartthorson-18694,2,I watched with an open mind,"I had read all the bad reviews, but decided to give Madame Webb a chance when it popped up on Netflix.The premise is fine. The writing is abhorrent. The production value is slightly above network TV, the FX are ridiculously bad. I think we have to agree at this point that Dakota Johnson is just not a very good actress. Sydney Sweeney (who I liked in Anyone But You) is indescribably awful.What frustrates me most about bad movies, especially those with big Hollywood budgets, is first: How is such a bad movie even made?, and secondly, with quality writers, producers, directors, and actors this could have been a great film. It's almost like the studio intended to make something that was an attack on your belief in movies.It should have been a horror movie. It tried to be sort of a scary, but fun girls trip of a movie, but it failed at every attempt.The first act, setting up Cassandra Webb's backstory and emergence of her abilities, is watchable. The ending is nothing short of a total trainwreck."
s_himes,3,Reviewing in real time,"The opening is bad you have a thief stealing basic information about a spider he has been researching for 4 years . The mother is shot and Madame Web is born to a tribe of spider people. Next she is driving an ambulance slowly throw NY ... How did she get there? Jungle baby to ambulance driver..hmmm? Next strange scene upside down car can't open the door so opens the opposite door... but her partner open the drivers door? All the door shut and she falls into the water... was a dream wakes up with her partner, how she get out of the car? Apparently she died and partner saved her. I hope this gets better..Cut to opera man who killed the mother and stole the spider meets and has sex with a woman has a dream and decides to kill the dream girls. He kills the woman to get a password using poison from his touch. She works at NSA. Cuts to her at a fireman's house BBQ joking about her death. Cooking burger jokes no beer after dying hahaha? BBQ is a baby shower. Terrible sequence about mother dying haha? Time slips are occurring. Fire at the dock. More time slips... going back and forth future past, she sees coworker crash Coworkers crashes and dies. Terrible fake crying. Little glycerine would have helped with the tears, Cut to mothers killer searching for dream spider women who will kill him. He stole the spider and has it in a case (previous scene) somehow the made him rich. He tells his worker he has to find the girls from the dream and kill. Worker says they are too young. He says find them... Worker obeys. Web is home and realizes she can change the vision or time jump. Decides to go to dead coworkers funeral, dream girls are at the train station at the same time. Villian's worker report to him and spills coffee. All girls on same train Web has visions of their deaths. Action scene? Through visions Web and girls escape but villain kills a few policeman because, why not? Bad sequence...Villain has superpowers but just kills the cops leaving the girls to run. They steal a taxi and have terrible dialog in the taxi.. Web is wanted by the police for kidnapping. She tells them to leave then tells them they can't dialog is really bad. Cut to forest and girls argue, Web leaves girls in the woods girls want food.. Web says coming back in 3 hours. And don't do dumb things. What am I watching? Web read mother dairy and give a little backstory 1 hour into movie. Girls go to diner and trucker calls cops giving villain their location... Web looks for girls runs to diner. Dream fight sequence girls do table dance why? Dream fight everyone dies reboot they escape. Web is immune to Villains poison. Some horrible dialog. Villain can talk to Web in her dreams tells her girls must die and to tell her where they are and he won't kill her. Web teachers girls CPR and that will save the day. Some background. Web goes to Peru leaves girls with Parks a Recreation guy. Police are looking for and she just flies to Peru? For som,e reason director want the bus to shake back and forth? 50-100,000 dollar budget hit for that effect I imagine. 20 minutes left and we get some backstory... Flashback to beginning. Why mother went to Peru is revealed. Cut back to city villain wants girls. P&R guy sister is giving birth. Wth a paramedic put the woman in the back of a 2 door car? They rush to hospital villain rushes to catch them. Traffic jam stops progress. Web has a vision how to beat villain. And here we go...end isn't terrible of course cpr saves the day. Voice overs were not done well.. if it was a Nextflix movie B Marvel blockbuster D."
Ryantm3,4,I mean...okay...,"Is it terrible? No. Is it amazing? No. But is it good...also no. I'd say the movie is bad-ish. Seems like there was potential, and Dakota Johnson is actually really good in it, but the writing and directing...I mean, my God. And how many times are you going to yell at us...IT'S 2003! The gratuitous shots of Blockbuster Video, Beyonce's ""new"" album Dangerously In Love, the Scream movie playing, or the action sequence with Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" playing. We get it! While Dakota Johnson is a good actress, it seems like that's where the good acting ends. With the rest of the girls, it seems like the director gave them one shot to get it right...and they didn't. Then the villain, I mean that guy was terrible. I don't know if the writing made him bad or if he's just that bad. And was his voice dubbed? Also, the whole movie was made just to set up the sequel, which there obviously won't be. Overall, could've been much better than it was, but worst movie ever made, no."
makeham98,3,Could it really be that bad? Yes.,"A movie with a bad cast and a storyline that misses both the casual MCU fan and the comic fanboy.First, the cast. We need a poetry slam between Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney. Two of the most monotonic actors in the world. Sydney has no business in this movie playing a nerdy looking high school girl who keeps her clothes on.If you don't know the source material (Spider-Man) you'll be lost as they've made it about everyone but him. The multiple Spider-Woman characters over the years are named the same as the teens. But that's meaningless if you don't know their outcomes. It's just a meandering mess.If you do know the various Spider-Women, you'll be bored waiting for something - anything - to happen.The movie takes the worst of Marvel origin stories - like Ang Lee's Hulk - making you sit through superfluous character development in what you thought was a superhero movie.Add in the confusing parts of The Flash (DC) with time jumps that will give you a headache if you aren't familiar either. Like the mother/daughter reunion.Worst of all, Madame Web in the comics was a powerful character. This version is not at all."
chalisswyler,4,Oh WOW,"PLEASE WATCH!This movie was such a horrible time!I hated every minute of it! There is absolutely no character build up or action scenes. The story line makes absolutely no sense! It makes teenage girls look so useless and party figured. Madam web never exists? Her mother was who? And why she chased a spider? What about the multiverse that covers the actual comic?Who's the villain? Why is he a villain?Why do the main characters matter? Uhm?You'll never know in the most undeveloped marvel movie ever made.Give up please.DO NOT make a sequel. But you will, suck.Left with more questions than answers.Horrible waste of time."
Artemur,5,Awkward and corny superhero flick,"If I wanted to describe Madame Web with a word, it would be awkward. Everything about this movie, like the acting, story progression, character motivations and behaviors in some situations, and photography, is awkward. It really feels like a confused movie that wasn't sure what it wanted to be or didn't know what was wanted to succeed with the story and characters. This movie also proves Dakota Johnson is a really bland actress. She is just listlessly going through motions during the movie, and watching her terrible acting is really agonizing. The other three teenage girls acting is equally terrible, especially Sydney Sweeney. This movie has really become a punch bag and object of derision for people because of its campiness and awkwardness. It's considered one of the worst superhero movies, but overall, it's just a forgettable and corny superhero flick. I think it's ideal for home watching but definitely not worth a cinema matinÃ©e."
usamaafzaal,6,Just watch it for the Beautiful Dakota Johnson,"The Fiction in the movie could be more realistic where Madame Web is suddenly capable of seeing the future. All that and the team up of the Girls is a poor writing of the script and direction. A lot of unrealistic and cartoon typed graphics is also the reason of the movie declined.Dakota's acting is not the best but is better than all of the other cast, perhaps she did her best but the story was not rightfully directed also the editing of the sequences has flaws.So just watch it for the gorgeous DAKOTA and her beautiful smiles and of-course her struggled acting is much better to keep the movie alive."
lukerhynalds,1,I'd give this movie negative stars if I could.,"The only thing worse than this movie is the IMDB app, and this app is hot garbage. None of the characters are correct. The story makes absolutely no sense and is more proof that Sony has zero business holding this franchise. It's more Morbius nonsense where the protagonist and antagonist all have the same powers/abilities but one is evil and the other isn't. It's the laziest writing you can imagine and the first half of the movie is them replaying sections of the movie in 5 minute intervals, followed by the main character saying, ""haven't we done this before"" but like over and over.It's the worst thing I've ever seen and I've seen videos of cancer consuming whole organs."
bobbenelson,9,Unexpected pleasure,"I don't know why people actually gave the show bad reviews. I am a superhero and sci-fi enthusiast. I found the show very captivating from the very beginning until the end. I don't wanna spoil it. I was just looking online to make sure if there was another movie coming out. It left me wanting to watch more. My nine out of 10 is based on intriguing from the very start, the character developments, and I liked the acting. I think the whole ensemble did very well. It has plenty of action, and a very interesting dynamic between the woman and the three other characters. The other supporting cast is also very good. I really think that people need to give this one a chance and take a watch and reply. I hope you really enjoy it like I did."
freshervbeats,7,Decent,This is why you don't jump on the bandwagon. No this wasn't Spider-Man homecoming. And the ending was to be expected. This movies sets up 3 potential super heroes. Men don't want to go see women heroes. And women aren't as into hero movies like men are. Who doesn't want to see bad spiderman get whooped. The leading actor did well. And the supporting actors were ok. Overall the box office tore this movie apart with their expectations to see something like spiderman. I honestly remember no promotion for this movie. The media failed to support the women characters as they did in marvel. It could have been written better but it wasn't a bad movie. Definitely don't feel like it was a waste of time. It was interesting at the least.
nihilizm,,the follow the sheep thing is happening... I liked it,"Why dont those who think they can do better - get that phone out and actually do something construcive with it and bring it on - come on do better - no? - I diddnt think so - I have a lady crush on Dakota always have - Sydney Sweeny coolest Celeb name ever - Doesnt really suite the whole innocent girly vibes - as we all have seen her in Uuphoria as that floozey lost teenager - and actually? - I wasnt doing that kind of stuff in High School - seriously? - I was like woooow ok thats how it is - lost children absent parents more like hollywoods good looking 20 somethings acting like young teenagers - err back to Dakota and the ""younglings"" 20 somethings - Marvel is so cheesy the movies are for young impressionable kids. Yes your young children have thier vapes and faces pressed against thier phones on some app watching these movies. Could be worse - want them to watch Euphoria instead?. YEA NAH."
jace_the_film_guy,1,Why do I want a Pepsi now?,"When I review movies, I genuinely try to look for the positive and try not to mock the filmmakers' efforts. Any criticism that I have is to educate and to elevate storytelling, not to poke holes or nitpick. With that in mind, there are not a lot of positives about ""Madame Web"".The film boasts a well-known cast with actors like Dakota Johnson (""Fifty Shades of Grey""), Sydney Sweeney (""Euphoria"") and Adam Scott (""Parks and Recreation""). Similarly, there are some characters in this movie who have genuinely interesting backstories, like Ben Parker. The moments which explore those backgrounds are the highlight of the film.I can honestly say that ""Madame Web"" is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. There were multiple times that the audience audibly laughed at moments which were not meant to be funny. The acting is poor, the script doesn't do the actors any favors and the story takes too long to develop. Not only that, but for a movie advertised as an ""action film"", there is little to no action.In filmmaking, there is a common practice called Automated Dialogue Replacement (ADR). Simply put, the actors will record replacement lines in a sound booth after a scene has been shot. Filmmakers use this technique to change dialogue when a line is muffled or when the script is altered in post-production. There is a surprising amount of ADR used in this film, specifically with the villain, Ezekiel Sims. Not only is his replacement dialogue off-putting and unnatural, but often it doesn't match the actor's mouth. This is one of the contributing factors which makes Ezekiel the worst comic book villain that I have ever seen on the big screen, and I have reviewed over 90 comic book films.""With great power comes great responsibility."" That line from the original ""Spider-Man"" film is one of the most well-known and respected pieces of dialogue in comic book history. There is a line in this movie when Madame Web is told ""When you take on the responsibility, power will come."" This insulting change of a beloved quote perfectly explains this film. There is no vision, no heart, and no real purpose. If you are going to see the movie, I would suggest going to see it in theaters, because watching it with a laughing audience makes for an enjoyable theater experience.Best Character: Anya
Best Quote: Not ""I've never said this before, but you're a really good teacher.""
Best Scene: Not the CPR scene.Best Piece of Score: ""Forgiveness"""
JohnDeSando,,A fresh take on super heroines.,"Just when I thought the Marvel Universe had no where to grow, along comes the endearing Madame Web. Anchored by Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, with her coy smile and I-got-it attitude, this superhero barely shows her powers largely because she's not fully aware about what they are, except for a curious ability to see into the immediate future.Without the usual overdose of bombs and fisticuffs of the formulaic super-hero films, Madame Web accentuates the humanistic sides of its heroes, including three teen-age ""orphans"": Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Mattie (Celeste O'Connor), and Anya (Isabela Merced), who hook up with Cassandra, all four on the lam from a pesty black-costumed spider out of an Amazon arachnid tribe that will eventually bring us the goody-boy Spider Man. But right now, Cassandra is at the forefront of heroic activity as she seeks answers such as the death of mom in the jungle and why her fingers tingle.I like this minimalist adventure because even usually-vacuous teens have interesting personalities and traits that, unbeknownst to them, will serve in the future as they assume their super-hero mandates. Meanwhile, jousting with Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), the man who double-crossed Cassandra's mom in '73 Amazon, means stopping traffic and trains and disorienting the bad boy in the slow revelation of Cassandra's emerging power and leadership and their own ability to survive without parents. Although Ezekiel is one of the most boring villains ever, the emphasis is on the emerging heroines.While the search for parents and roots has been a romantic staple for years, especially in super-hero films, Madame Web gives a touch of reality as our 4 heroines have realistic reasons for being untethered. They act civil, not the usual way for teens in this genre.Although the buzz on Madame Web has been modest and the time of year indicative of the studio's lack of confidence, with Dakota Johnson's Casandra in charge, I can see a bright future for a genre showing its age. Getting bitten by a Peruvian bug has definite life-enhancing advantages."
Lewis_Heather787,2,What were they thinking?,"I'll be totally honest the only reason I watched this film was due to the horrendous reaction to it. I was very interested to see how bad it could possibly be or were the critics wrong.In short no, the critics and now audiences aren't wrong whatsoever.Genuinely I have no idea what anybody associated with this film was doing. How on earth is a film like this allowed to even be green lit by the studio. Is it laziness or just a lack of care, to be honest I fear it was the potential of a quick cash grab.The only reason I'm not giving it a 1/10 is because the cast are at least trying to salvage this horror show, I don't blame them fully. Although I do wonder why on earth they even said yes to doing on it, on the basis of this script. The money must have been good! Saying that I've never really rated Dakota Johnson, she always seems to pick strange projects to be involved with. I don't dislike her or think she is a bad actress in general however in this she goes full Tommy Wiseau! I was laughing a lot when she was on screen and wasn't meant to be. The rest of the cast are trying at least apart from her.20% out of 100, its about as terrible as everyone said it was. In reality though I am saddened that this quality of film is the standard for some people to be released. I don't really have anything positive to say.You can imagine the shock I had watching this after ""Dune : Part Two"", like they were made in different worlds."
subxerogravity,3,I should not have went to see this.,"It's not that I can't believe how bad this movie is, it's that I can't believe how little I got out of it. I got nothing. Just a complete waste of time if there ever was. The Spider-Man connections were cute but did not come with enough fan service to save this burning hot garbage.I mean, how did this get made? It's been a long time since Dakota Johnson starred in the 50 Shades Trilogy. That wasn't even good but it would make sense if Madam Web came out closer to that time. Also, think it would make more sense if Sydney Sweety was Madame Web, being an up-and-coming star.Yeah man, nothing to justify here, don't see it! Ever!!"
esmelly,1,I'm in physical pain,"I've never left a review for a movie in my 30 years here on earth. If you value your time and sanity and everything you stand for as a normal person, do not watch this movie. My girlfriend drug me to see this today and this isn't your typical bad movie. It's a one of kind, impressive I might add, atrocity of a movie? It's worse than a movie. It's an eye sore and I physically cringed through most of the movie.The writing for the villain is incredibly dull and weak & the plot successfully accomplishes zero things. The entire plot is a set up for a sequel(s) that I doubt will ever come & the whole plot could be summarized in a 2-3 min flashback which would be far more entertaining than anything this movie could imagine.I'm begging you, save your time and money. I wish I could give negative or zero stars but 1/10 will have to do."
aleckleinsmith,1,Only saw it since I have AMC AList,"Admittedly, not big into superhero movies and really happy they're struggling because I'd love to see original ideas and new concepts without garbage CGI and awful dialogue (Thor: Love & Thunder being a prime example). Madame Web is just as terrible as the reviews suggest.At first, I wondered if this was possibly do to make trolls who leave poor scores and reviews featuring a cast primarily of women. However, that is not the case with this movie - it's just offensively terrible.Sony needs to stop trying to make these kinds of films. Again, not a fan of them in general but there's a few I really enjoyed (Logan and Blade, which is how I like comic book/superhero movies done - dark and gritty with blood and violence).Avoid at all costs."
camillejnae,2,Shame on Sony!,"SONY should STOP making ""super hero"" movies, that studio is ruining the genre! For nerds like me, I love a good story pulled from a comic, it doesn't have to have the best actors, but it does need to have a great script, excellent direction, and amazing visuals - that's the formula. Sony seems to think the best formula is A list actors + crappy script + mediocre direction + unbelievable visuals + excellent product placement is the formula. THEY ARE WRONG. We need to boycott Sony superhero movies, just wait for it to come out on a streaming service you already pay for, maybe then they'll get the memo that they suck at this and they'll sell the rest of the Marvel IP catalog to it's rightful owners, so they can do what's best with it.This movie was a poor representation of the comic story, the comic characters deserved better, the actors deserved a better script and better direction, and the visual artists deserved a better vehicle for their talent. Shame on Sony. Shame. Shame. Shame."
danieljfarthing,6,Passable if imperfect Marvel flick with less bloated CGI & cast than usual,"In 2003-based Marvel flick ""Madame Web"" NY ambulance driver (with Adam Scott) Dakota Johnson learns she's psychic due to mum Kerry Bishé's jungle trip when pregnant... where she crossed baddie Tahar Rahim who now has superpowers with which to try killing teens Sydney Sweeney (looking so young), Celeste O'Connor & Isabela Merced - who Johnson protects while learning the secrets of her past. For this one co-writer (with three others) / director SJ Clarkson didn't get all Marvel's usual bloated CGI or mega-cast (tho Emma Roberts is also in support), but it's still passable (if not perfect - especially its action sequences). It sure beats ""The Marvels"" anyway."
themermaid_a,1,I'm honestly sore from cringing,"Oh my god the acting, I was literally dying of embarrassment the entire time. I honestly couldn't tell if Dakota Johnson intentionally sabotaged the project by being this bad, or if she's really just a terrible actress. Apparently the budget for this movie was about $200 million. Seriously? The editing is so bad it's like they just gave all the clips to a middle school computer class and told them to do whatever they want. The main idea of the story is somewhat unique, so at least I'll give them that. It doesn't really fit into the spider man universe though (not the most popular and most current one anyway), so I don't think many people will watch this since it's irrelevant to the current marvel universe. It's sad how this plot/idea really did have potential, but we ended up with this..."
Tayyasqueen,8,Enjoyable and Worth the Watch!,"This movie is great! It held my interest the entire film, and was enjoyable to watch. My boyfriend enjoyed it equally as much. We are both glad that we ignored many of the negative reviews, and went and decided for ourselves. Going in with low expectations, we were truly pleasantly surprised. This movie is not like some of the other marvel movies that are action packed, with an array of superheroes, and a storyline for the dull-witted. I question if that is what the haters were hoping to see with this? Dakota did a superb job playing her role, and so did the supporting cast. Go watch while still in theaters!"
zdro-178-201487,7,"Sorry, not sorry. We liked it!","For me, this is a different take on a super-hero movie. That was part of the appeal, because it didn't follow the typical formula, where the hero has it rough, something scary happens, and the next thing you know, they're flinging bad guys around like rag dolls. This is not full of ridiculous, CGI-laden battles. It's more of a personal story.One of the things we liked most was the way they showed us the evolution of her abilities from her perspective. She wasn't an instant superhero. She was a regular, relatable person for the duration, and a more realistic take on what someone would go through emotionally and/or mentally if supernatural things were happening to them. It would be confusing, scary, and you'd still be vulnerable. So, she doesn't instantly become a genius at using her abilities, but is still put in a position of protecting others. We got to see the disorienting progression from her perspective. I thought Dakota Johnson portrayed this well!Sure, this isn't the pillar of movie making. There are some inconsistencies, and some cheesiness, but whatever. Everybody's a critic."
landersfarm,1,I hope you didn't waste money for it,I can't believe how bad it is. It's almost bad enough to be good but unfortunately they really just made a hot confusing mess. This could have been a good movie however it's not. I like the cast but the script and directing makes one cringe. I certainly hope this doesn't derail the careers of the cast as I've seen them in other movies where they didn't suck. It's must have been hard for them to keep from rolling their eyes when saying the dialogue. Didn't anyone speak up during filming to say anything? I wish the cast good luck in their future endeavors and not let this drag them down. I would be furious if I was producers and the is what they got for their momey.
Orki72,3,They did it!,"Okay, so first of all, I have no problem with a blockbuster with female leads or female directors or anything. I think all the haters should start learning that it's outdated to think a movie is bad because it wasn't directed by a man or doesn't have a male lead. If anybody gave this one a bad review because of this reasons, shame on you!I just wish this movie had all of that, because unfortunately it conforms to those prejudices, even though the lead actresses do everything they can to make it not (and so they earned the three stars!).The story is sooo full of plotholes and flat that you can hardly stand it. If this script was so cobbled together and patched up, all credit to the writers, they have no idea about suspense, comics or even (good) movies. They did it. And it has by far the worst CGI since...Twilight I think. There are so many errors in this story that you ask yourself, how this was even greenlit? Didn't anyone see this before the release or do the movie exec just don't care? I hope it's not the latter.This movie should be shown at film schools as a prime example of how not to do it."
Entertainmentsparadise,2,Street level movie,"Just caught Madame Web m, and sadly, it falls short of expectations. Dakota Johnson's performance lacks conviction, leaving the film feeling flat. The camera work and scenes left me puzzled, with moments that seemed more suited for a low-budget production or a Netflix release. While reminiscent of Netflix superhero series like Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Daredevil, and Jessica Jones, Madame Web lacks the weight for a mainstream theatrical release, lacking real threats, emotional appeal, and that signature Marvel impact. The villain's lip sync voiceover only added to the disconnect. What really dampened the experience was the absence of a post-credit scene-no anticipation, no boom. Madame Web failed to leave its mark."
stanislavhadzhiev,2,As bad as superhero movies get,"This movie is just an awful combination of bad and lazy writing, bad editing and anything wrong that can be done with a movie overall. How did they even see the final cut and decided ""Yup, that's it. Good job guys."". To be fair Dakota Johnson is fine. She's working with what she's given. The 3 actresses that did the future spider something characters are okay. Their characters are empty and default anyways. We see basically nothing from them. The villain is comically bad written and portrait. He's like a villain from a 90s Batman movie, but with even less soul in him. Logic of events - don't ask for it.Just No. Don't ever do another movie like that. Better burn the money that you would use for it. It will be a better use of them."
BlockLike,1,11/10 on the Gods of Egypt scale,"This is the first film to break my Gods of Egypt scoring system and deserves a recording breaking 11/10.If you haven't guessed already, a high score on this system is not a good thing.Despite tying, I could not find one redeeming feature about this film.The acting is almost unbearable, the casting is awful, the writing is dreadful, lazy and basic, the plot (haha plot) is non-existant, the editing is woeful.I could go on, but what's the point.It's as if the film was made by people random ideas out of a hat and the hat only had bad ideas in it.Thing film has one achievement though. It managed to go beyond and discover a whole new realm of bad.Chew on some sandpaper instead. It'll be more fun."
huntermiriam,1,Did a high school teenager write this script?,"My God what a horrible movie!!!Absolutely no character building, no plot and just gut wrenching corny lines.I was looking forward to seeing more of her powers and you don't get to see much until the very end which was also a huge let down.Very mellow dramatic. The story was slow and didn't make sense. The action scenes were meh. There were characters that weren't even needed in this movie and the ones that were in the movie had zero focus.An embarrassment in trying to represent women in strong roles. Such a sad, sad disappointment.I'd say more but why waste my time it was already wasted."
ib011f9545i,7,the trend of popular opinion is not always correct,"The trend of popular opinion is not always correct.Do I have to mention nazi Germany or Mr Tarantino or Oasis (British band)?Ok I am overstating the comparisons but in January 1933 Hitler was a hip guy.I am a habitual cinema goer.I go at least one a week so I see a lot of films.Among the films that are less worthwhile watching in the last 3 years would be Morbius,Thor love and Thunder,the first Wakanda film and Aquaman 2.Although I am an old guy I like most of the Marvel type films especially the Batman ones.I honestly think Madame Web is a good film and because I have a cinema season ticket I expect I will watch it twice.Leaving aside the idea of being in step with the crowd I think I know why people might not like/appreciate this film.For a film of its kind it actually has a plot which means people should stop playing with their phones and eating crap and actually watch the film.If you like these sort of films especially if you are a Spiderman person I don't see how you can fail to enjoy this film.But realistically popular opinion will probably take a while to give a fair opinion of this film,so we probably won't get a sequel."
just_fun-82481,2,Slightly better than 'The Marvels '?,"This movie has a lot of slow moments with all the 'deja vu' scenes and those flashbacks took away from the action scenes at the end. I still don't get the main villain in this story. Why was he going to be the target of the 'gonna be powerful someday spider girls' anyway? The young actresses opposite Dakota Johnson would have made this a 4 star rating had I been a straight hormone enraged teenage boy or lesbian in waiting. Slightly better than the 'The Marvels ' and for the first time I was relieved that there were no extra scenes during the credits as I was ready to swing out of there, web or no web!"""
fyrce1-916-538290,9,This movie was good,"I don't know what people, or critics are talking about. The only thing I can think of is that this is all about women. This current society full of toxic male, and female point of views is ruining the movie experience. This movie is everything I loved about the graphic novel. I think the hardest thing about this movie is that people don't know the source material. This is the source material. This is the origin point of four characters, and watching Marvel fans who gush about Sony's Spider-Man versus this movie are a different breed. They absolutely hated Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man, and his series was more comic accurate than the Tobey Maguire material everyone loves. I enjoy the spider-verse. If people can't enjoy these comic accurate movies than they are just these new breed of short term Marvel fans that need movie after movie, or a Netflix 18 episode series to explain every detail. This is a movie. They are telling a story in a short time span. I think it was fun, and excellent."
paul_haakonsen,6,Another superhero popcorn movie...,"Right, well I was in no particular rush to get to watch the 2024 superhero movie ""Madame Web"". First of all, I am not overly keen on superheroes, but I do watch them for the pure mindless action and entertainment that they prove to be. And secondly, I had no idea who the Madame Web character was, and had never heard about her, I suppose it is because I don't read Marvel superhero comic books.Yet, when I was presented with an opportunity to sit down and watch ""Madame Web"", I did so. And it was fully and wholly without any expectations, so director S. J. Clarkson had every opportunity to entertain and bedazzle me.Writers Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S. J. Clarkson and Kerem Sanga put together a script and storyline that actually proved to be entertaining enough for what it was. It wasn't anything jaw-dropping or overly impressive, but it proved to be an adequately enough entertaining superhero movie. A popcorn movie, if you will, because the narrative requires no cerebral activity from the audience; just lean back, watch the movie and enjoy the snacks.However, I have to admit that I am a bit surprised that so many writers collectively could not manage to produce a script that proved to be more impressive or entertaining. I'm not saying that it was a bad script, not at all, because it was entertaining enough for sure, but all those creative forces should have been able to put together a more outstanding script.The acting performances in the movie were good. I am not familiar with leading actress Dakota Johnson, but she carried the movie quite well with her performance as Cassandra Webb. The younger actresses Sydney Sweeney (playing Julia Cornwall), Isabela Merced (playing Anya Corazón) and Celeste O'Connor (playing Mattie Franklin) were nicely cast and put on great performances, especially Sydney Sweeney. Of the entire cast in the movie, I was only familiar with Mike Epps and Adam Scott.I wasn't familiar with a single character in the storyline, as I don't read Marvel superhero comic books, so I don't know how true the writers were to the source material.Visually then ""Madame Web"" was good. The special effects and CGI effects were good, and definitely added something to the overall impression of the movie.I was adequately entertained by ""Madame Web"" and my rating lands on a six out of ten stars."
nortava,3,"Bad, Worse, Worst - a sad acknowledgement","Despite the controversy surrounding the film, I held onto some optimistic expectations, thinking, ""It can't possibly be that bad."" However, after investing approximately two hours of my time into it, I'm disappointed to say that my sentiments remain unchanged.The plot is lacking, the actors/resses not well used, and the overall progression feels aimless. Even the 'final fight', which held potential, fails to deliver any significant impact.It's no surprise that even performers like Sydney regard the film as a disappointment.The lingering question remains: Where does this universe go from here? What meaningful contributions does this film offer for future installments?Unfortunately, no clear answers emerge (yet).."
prayerfulpraise,2,Intrigue led to disappointment,"I don't always agree with reviews ... the previews looked good ... I was interested. The outline provided in the preview was not the intriguing plot line that unfolded over the course of a two hour movie. The script was horrid and provided a very shallow starting point for the heroine. I am not opposed to ""girl power"" movies that are organic in nature but the whole thing felt forced. I am uncertain as to whether the acting was to the caliber of a high school production or if the script and direction was just that poorly done. The film oscillated between campy and drama. The script was just so stiff and provided no dynamic for the actors. The plot was fairly predictable like a teen drama on CW from the early 00's."
dshepherd-02328,2,Blocks of wood have more character than Johnson,"Madame Web, a cinematic experience where the most thrilling twist is discovering the set's uncanny resemblance to a high school drama club's weekend project. Imagine stepping into a world where 'wooden' doesn't just describe the acting but also the set pieces, which, one might argue, deliver more dynamic performances than our leads. The set, a marvel of budgetary constraints, looks like it was borrowed from a B movie's garage sale, adding an unintended layer of comedy to the supposed suspense.The plot, much like the decor, weaves a web of confusion, leaving audiences wondering if the real supernatural power was the ability to make the script disappear into thin air. Madame Web seems to have spun a tale too far from its comic book roots, entangling itself in a cocoon of mediocrity.In a world brimming with superhero spectacles, Madame Web swings and misses, landing in the forgotten realms of movie mishaps. It's a reminder that not all heroes wear capes; some just desperately cling to the hope that their audience will forget to write a review."
GryeD,1,Must be removed from this world,"I saw this on Netflix randomly and noticed it hasn't even been that long since the theatrical release. Yet somehow....it's already on Netflix? That's not a good sign.To be frank, I had a hard time watching the movie as I desperately found myself wanting to look away.Reading my books is more fun than this
Playing my games brings more joy than this
Watching any other movie makes more sense than thisI was puzzled beyond belief as the story was just..... a group of girls going to various places. There was a lack of establishment in terms of foundation and storyline that would normally pull people into superhero-themed movies.What was the point of this movie? I don't get it. I don't see it. I don't FEEL it.The story itself is so darn incomplete, reinforced with terrible pacing.Madame Web? No.... she doesn't deserve that title after this trash heap."
auralismjhana,2,Not the right kind of bad to be funny,"The movie starts downhills to eventually hit rock bottom.I typically enjoy characters and story above all else, but none of the characters are fleshed out or understandable. The CGI is terrible. I was unaware that the movie took place in 2003, but the CGI is definitely from that era. I couldn't help but laugh every time they used itCassie, the MC, is a paramedic who doesn't want to help anyone or be around other people. The three girls are caricatures of their trope - the smart girl too focused on school, the nerdy girl who would be hot without her glasses, and the neglected rich girl who acts out. The bad guy grew up poor and neglected before he was able to make it on his own. Her friend just... goes along with everything without requiring any answers. Ride or die, I guess.The story is linear with no twists or turns. I typically enjoy fighting in superhero movies, but this was definitely less fighting and using the convenient terrain and super convenient options available. Whatever least surprising thing you can think of is probably what happened.It's bad, but not the same level of bad as a b movie, but not bad enough to end up being funny. Dakota Johnson had to have decided before the movie on what this movie was going to be and just stopped caring. If you like awkward humor then she might give you a few smiles in the movie. Her interviews about the movie are hilarious and honest.2 stars for the few laughs I had. No stars for anything else, especially not the costume department."
jonmacik71,2,Watching a documentary on clipping your toenails would be much more interesting,"This one is rough to watch. I would suggest doing push ups till you pass out, swimming a few hundred miles, or running from a lion or grizzly bear as much more fun and exciting than watching this bomb. I was intrigued by the idea of this movie, so I figured why not.. let's see how interesting they can make a movie that doesn't sound that interesting. And I'm trying to take up words now just to try and help others avoid wasting their time on this bomb. Take the money instead and buy yourself dinner and throw on a classic because watching this movie is a waste and it really isn't a good movie. Thank you for reading this."
salo_aizenberg,6,"Totally reasonable movie, far better than its reputation","I saw the reviews and expected to see one of the worst movies ever. After 30 minutes I was waiting to turn if off. Then an hour and then more. This is certainly not a great movie or even a very good one. Sure some of the dialogue is not great, but this is true of most superhero movies. But it is average to above average. I have seen far far worse superhero movies. Like Morbius at 5.1 rating or Green Lantern 5.5 and many others. Black Adam at 6.2 is well over rated. It seems like the reputation that this was among the worst movies ever stuck and everyone rated it a 1. It's not. It's a totally reasonable movie and the right rating is somewhere in the 5 to 6 range."
mwelch-66130,1,I cannot believe this isn't a joke movie,"This is complete trash. It's like they're making fun of themselves, but don't know it. It's weird. I feel bad for Adam Scott. Hopefully he got paid. This movie isn't even making fun of, but I had required characters. The lack of characters in this film is worse than watching reruns of below deck. What were they thinking? Marvel is a mess and this I turned on as a spoof and realized they are literally making movies for idiots. My favorite line?""We will all die someday"" yeah. We will. That's how life and death work.Oh, and more...there is so much product placement I feel like I'm watching a Ghostbusters film. Idiots."
petlinskii,8,I didn't look at my watch during the movie.,"Spider person - That's a good joke, my wife was delighted. The movie overall ain't half bad, got a nice pace to it, almost feels like a throwback to the 2007-2010 style.I especially want to emphasize the good quality of the picture.Of course, the movie has its drawbacks and gaffes, especially the whole line with the taxi - the main character quietly drove around the city in a stolen car, and then without license plates - I understand that this is post-irony - and I laughed and criticized this ridiculous move and the joke is so ridiculous that it did not leave a dark spot on the movie. I don't understand why the movie caused a lot of negativity even before it was released on the big screens - although it's a trend, so I won't interfere, as they say ""Everyone has the right to eat s* *t and ask for more"" but this is not about Fallout)."
legolandfan,7,A victim of poor publicity and unwarranted hate.,"Madame Web was good.Like, I actually really liked it.Sure, some of the dialogue was stunted, but I guess they have to overexplain concepts in superhero movies if it involves anything beyond skybeams and blowing stuff up. Gotta make the MCU bros understand, I guess.I'm still confused about why Sims' dialogue wasn't synced up right most of the time, but his voice was just weird already so it didn't make much of a difference.Dakota Johnson was fine, but Sydney Sweeney was the real standout among the main four for me. Aside from being one of my celebrity crushes, I thought her performance was very subtle, and a change from much of the more sexualized roles she is known for.Adam Scott as Ben Parker was really cool. The line about ""all the fun and none of the responsibility"" followed up by Cassie's ""that's what he thinks"" was very clever. While obviously hinting at Peter Parker's responsibility as Spider-Man and Ben's famous words to him, it also references the responsibility that Ben has to protect Peter, which gives greater weight to why Ben understands responsibility so well.I won't say Ben stole the show, because he wasn't in it enough to do that and it would take away from the leading ladies. It took a little bit to warm up to them, but it also took them a bit to warm up to each other, so that's kinda the point. These are four strangers who were just forced into a crazy situation, and they don't really know who to trust or who to like. But they actually have some character growth and learn to open up to each other.I kinda wish there was more of the actual Spider-Women, but this movie isn't about that, it's about Cassie becoming Madame Web. It's not a Spider-Women movie, it's a movie about the women who become Spiders.The marketing for this movie was weird. Like the trailer was intriguing (at least to me) but everything else seemed off. ""Made by AI"" maybe, but the movie itself is unique in its concept to be a human original. I think we need to stop blaming ChatGPT and start blaming studio interference. Anyway, don't listen to me or anyone else about this movie, or any movie. If it looks interesting to you, go see it. If you have an open mind about movies, chances are you'll find something you like.Wow, this post is way longer than I thought it'd be. Thanks for reading this far, if you did ðŸ˜Š"
Lemonspatti7,1,Thought this movie was made by the C.W. network,"When I saw the trailer on Netflix, I honestly thought it was a made-for-TV movie by the C. W. network.But, when I hit play I was shocked to see it was made by Sony in association with Marvel. I can't believe Marvel approved this garbage.I've never written a review before, but this film is so bad that I feel Sony & Marvel need to hear my feedback.Madam Web is terrible in every possible way.Terrible cinematography, the picture quality looks like a telenovela.The characters are not relatable, or even likeable for that matter.The bad guy is lame, and bad actor.If you're looking for a slightly better superhero movie than this one, then I recommend ""Aquaman II, the search for more ways to exploit Jason Momoas' marginal fame"" -- mostly based on a few appearances in the hit series, Game of Thrones."
danielcookuk,2,"Sony, just give up making films!","Honestly, another poor effort by Sony at turning what could have easily been a great film into a plot hole ridden film. Shame, real shame.It started off well, but went downhill quickly, with gaps in the story that couldn't be overlooked, and an ending that just felt rushed and not fully thought through.It also looked like the bad guy character was heavily dubbed over too.One of the biggest things that I couldn't over look was how the lead character was able to travel to and from Peru on the same day!!?! Does Peru have its own time zone where one week is only a few hours in New York??Honestly Sony, just give up now and hand the rights back to Disney..... Pleeeeeease!!!"
dimitrisucy,3,What did I just watch!!!,Wow. Just wow. I tried to give this movie a chance. With all the negative press surrounding this movie I thought it was exaggerated!Boy was I wrong! This movie is hot garbage. I feel sorry for the actors that had to be in this so called movie.The story is beyond stupid. I couldn't care less for any of the characters. First few scenes in the Amazon and you could tell that the CGI budget for this movie must have been like a $100.The villain just comes off like some random dude in a halloween costume fighting teenage girls (which is exactly what this movie is) and every piece of dialogue out of his mouth sounds like a voice over from another actor!TLDR: Don't waste your time!
cjonesas,5,[5.5] Babysitter Web with prehistoric glasses,"The matter with Disney+ and Sony is that they make Marvel superheroes movies and series for kids and teens and Madame babysitter Web is no exception. The movie is not bad per se, it's just generic, has no character whatsoever, lacks thrills, intrigue and adrenaline-pumping storyline plots.The three young girls are just puppet dolls in the movie's script, Tahar Rahim is no superhero nor villain and his acting and beard are horrific in this one (have a shave and haircut man!), as for Dakota Johnson, as lovely as she is, she is not and does not personify Madame Web as hardcore Comics fans remember her in the Spidey's Comics stories.Dakota Johnson is super nice, but is too young & soft to play the character and her soft whispery voice and talking reminded me of lullabies that you may sing to a lion cub to help him/her find peace, lessen the stress and have a tight sleep with rosy dreams.When you read that the script underwent extensive changes and the original one was darker and meaner, you may ask yourself what is the point in making superhero movies on fluffy cushions just for the kids to eat popcorn and drink huge amount of soda, while the parents snore loudly amidst kids' big wows!P. S.

hariberi2009,1,STOP THESE SPIDERMAN LESS SPIDER MOVIES,"""Madame Web"" was poised to be a beacon of female empowerment in the superhero genre, but instead, it became a glaring testament to missed opportunities and lackluster performances, notably Dakota Johnson's. Despite her previous works, Johnson's portrayal of the titular character lacked the gravitas and depth required for such a pivotal role. Her performance felt surprisingly one-dimensional in a role that demanded nuance and complexity. It was as if she was merely going through the motions, failing to bring any genuine emotion or conviction to the character. This lack of engagement made it challenging for the audience to connect with or root for Madame Web, a crucial misstep for a film aiming to inspire and empower.Furthermore, the film's attempt to ride the ""girl power"" wave felt shallow and unearned. Characters, including Johnson's Madame Web, were thinly written, with their supposed strength coming off as contrived rather than authentic. The empowerment theme felt like an afterthought, a box checked off without genuine understanding or commitment to what true empowerment entails.The plot itself was a convoluted mess, exacerbated by pacing issues that left little room for character development or meaningful storytelling. This was a film caught in an identity crisis, unsure whether to embrace the seriousness of its potential or settle for generic action-comedy fare. Such indecision resulted in a tone that was inconsistently executed, further detracting from the narrative's impact.Visually, the film failed to impress as well. In an age where audiences are treated to spectacular visual effects, ""Madame Web"" felt outdated, with CGI that often appeared clumsy and unconvincing. Action sequences, which could have been a redeeming feature, were instead forgettable, lacking the excitement and creativity seen in other films of the genre.The dialogue did no favors either, laden with clichÃ©s and unsuccessful attempts at wit. It seemed as though the script was trying too hard to be current and edgy, but ended up feeling forced and awkward. This, combined with a predictable plot, rendered the viewing experience more tedious than enjoyable.In its attempt to highlight female strength and resilience, ""Madame Web"" significantly missed the mark. Dakota Johnson's uninspiring performance, coupled with a script that fails to truly empower, resulted in a film that is not only forgettable but also a disappointing contribution to both the superhero genre and the ongoing dialogue about female representation in cinema."

The writing, acting, editing, producing, lighting etc etc in that utter garbage runs rings around whatever this was.This was a nothing burger, there was just absolutely nothing. No plot, no storytelling, no character development, dialogue written by a crackhead with no arms while also high on mushrooms. I mean, I'm literally shocked. How did this even get approved lol?

NocturnalMammal,1,a cringe-worthy misadventure for Sony Marvel,"Madame Web is a cinematic disaster, a slap in the face of Marvel fans and comic book enthusiasts. The plot is convoluted and nonsensical. The acting is wooden and uninspired, with characters that are unidimensional and uninspiring. The direction is aimless and writing is lazy and unimaginative. The ending is a complete letdown, leaving audiences with more questions than answers. Madame Web is not just a bad Marvel movie, it's possibly the worst Marvel movie ever made. It's a disservice to comic book and Marvel fans everywhere. This film is a catastrophic failure on all fronts. Save yourself the agony and avoid this cinematic disaster at all costs."
maricarmenvazquez,8,I loved it,"The movie is very good, super entertaining and highly recommended. I hope the movie is more recognized after all, I still put a lot of effort into making it.

jp_91,7,"""Madame Web"" is a good movie that stands out from other superhero movies with better reviews.","""Madame Web"" is a rarity within the Marvel Universe, a film with a more serious script and without the typical forced jokes every 30 seconds, it is difficult to understand the hate and low ratings when films from the same company with trite and repetitive stories have extremely high scores and enter the IMDb Top 250. This film has something different to tell and it does it excellently, mixing drama and suspense. The performances are good, the chemistry between the four protagonists is natural and realistic. The director's work is spot on. The cinematography has quality visual merits, the soundtrack goes perfectly with the image on screen, the digital special effects are few and that is appreciated, and they do not look unreal like in other films produced by the aforementioned comic books company. A notable error is the costume and production design, as they fail to faithfully portray the era in which the film is set and it seems like a mishmash of fashions and furniture. ""Madame Web"" is a good movie that stands out from other superhero movies with better reviews."
ahiersaxe,,What the...?,"I think that we can safely say that Marvel is way past spiraling the drain, and is five feet down the pipe at this point.Honestly, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Battlefield Earth' had better writing, special effects, character development, and cohesion than this film. I went in knowing nothing about madame web, and came out exactly the same way.For what a trip to the movies coats nowadays, it'd be nice to not walk away feeling like you just wasted two hours of your life and a weeks pay. But that's exactly how I feel over and over again when it comes to Marvel films since the Infinity Saga ended.Do not watch this movie. Ever."
allenyuvrajnirban,1,This films provides argument for AI to be used in writing,"Hot trash. It even went below the level I originally thought. It was anticipated that this film would be bad ever since they dropped the trailer yet the film is literally disappointing those who had no hope. This film presents you mid 30's women acting like immature.teenagers,if anything this just.proves AI can have more human writing than the humans themselves. Film also has logicless scenes which will leave you chuckling as to how stupid someone can actually be and then you will start questioning your own sanity for choosing to watch this film in theatres by wasting your hard earned money on this. Recommendation is to stay away if you aren't interested in seeing some teenage drama queens in their mid 30's doing logicless stuff, bad dialogues and lastly horrible CGI effects."
freakystyleyua,1,Umm...,"Hands down the dullest of the Sony-verse. Paper thin plot with terrible characters. The acting itself is more or less ok but it makes me wonder if euphoria was a fluke for Sweeney. You can say almost every actor is great in something else, but leaves you extremely confused on what the talent level here actually is. Easily the worst villain in a long time. Motives are just plain dumb. At least venom was bad but for very different reasons. You don't really blame Tom Hardy for two movies. But you definitely feel like blaming the whole cast for this one. Let's me know Kraven will be absolute trash and Sony isn't really with anyone's time. This is what happens every time when you get people to play in a superhero universe who know absolutely nothing about source material. Madame Web is so important in the comics but feels way too light here, while also feeling like the spider family didn't get the paise they deserve. I've never seen a beginning, middle, and end, of a movie and thought it was a complete waste of time. If your a comic fan, you will only be heartbroken. If you are neutral, see this not sober and judge it from there."
lashacthed,1,I am ashamed to have watched it,I want refund for all my time. Literally everything was bad the starring acting script costumes special effects directing storytelling character development. I mean did they dig out those costumes from thrift store or something?Movie went in all directions for no reason past present and future. And they tried to jam in trailer for future movies or something hah like thats gonna happen. Any mediocre tv show has greater special effects and scripts then this. I am so confused and weirded out by this mess.How is this even a marvel movie I dont even get it. I have seen better movies from college students.
alyssafrantz,1,Easily the worst movie I've ever seen,"What. HAPPENED. How did anyone watch this and decide it was okay to release?! This film is such a joke - literally spent most of the movie laughing and facepalming. Less than a minute in, I could tell this was not going to be good. I've never been this close to walking out of a theater. Most boring, monotonous, repetitive plot/story with no climax or low point. Extremely unlikable characters with no direction and inconsistent motives. Very bad acting on everyone. One of the worst villains to ever exist. Bad editing and camera movements. I know nothing about these characters or story from the comics, and this movie cleared up absolutely nothing."
nicoarcus,1,Worst that The Marvels,"Madame Web swings onto the screen, but misses the mark with a plot riddled with holes and a story that fails to captivate. While the acting holds its own (half-decent, at best), it can't save this movie from its narrative woes. Special effects are passable, but forget groundbreaking.The biggest issue? Madame Web herself. An obscure character to begin with, the film struggles to make her relatable or engaging. Her origin story feels rushed and underdeveloped, leaving audiences with more questions than answers. The plot, meanwhile, is a tangled mess, jumping between timelines and dimensions without a clear thread. Plotholes abound, leaving viewers feeling lost and confused.Dakota Johnson delivers a decent performance, but even her charisma can't salvage the script's shortcomings. The supporting cast fares similarly, offering competent performances but lacking the spark to elevate the material.Ultimately, Madame Web is a forgettable experience. If you're looking for a superhero movie with a compelling story and engaging characters, look elsewhere. Save your money and grab a six-pack - you'll be better entertained and end up with a buzz.."
leorozman,1,Is this a joke?,"Ok, What did I just watch and I did I spend time on it?!This has to be the worst movie Ive watched in a long time!Sony has to stop making superhero movies , and today.Acting is so bad, that it makes ""Sharknado"" looks like it deserves an oscar. The characters are not likeable, at all. The villain is a lame joke.I just don't get it, the movie is ""big budget"" labled, yet hollywood keeps hiring unprofesionals writers that destroy the budget and eventually making THIS CRAP called ""MADAM WEB""
Honestly, Its not even a bad movie like a bad movie to watch when theres nothing else to do , or just to pass the time, Its just a garbage bad movie, that no one should pay to watch. EVER."
lakelivin-88618,7,"Good Film, Cut to Short","Like any film out there you're gonna have those who will absolutely hate the film no matter what happens. I chose to listen to the naysayers and not see this in the theater. I ended up watching it at home. Overall I enjoyed the movie. In my opinion, it was good but not great. Dakota Johnson did a great job as Madame Webb. I do think that if a Spider-Man character from a previous film had made a cameo, then it would've been so much better. This film definitely had potential. I enjoyed the Ben Parker reference, tying it to Spider-Man. Also in my opinion, I think this movie could've been so much better if they would've brought in a former Spider-Man. Maybe Toby McGuire or even Andrew Garfield. I wouldn't say no to a sequel. I'd be curious to see where they took the storyline."
Gowmes,2,Story is there but..,"I mean story is there but the characters are just not into anything
Dakota's acting on this movie is so ""meh""
The transitions and animations are so Sony 1990
We can't call this a Marvel Movie neither associated to Spider Man
The villain on this movie sometimes got his voice dubbed and the mouth is not even moving..
they could deliver so much more due to the actors/actress..
the girls dancing to Britney Spears in a fast food restaurant oh man so awkward that my face fell on the floor
Everything was bad and of course I can't give a good review on this one. Hopefully in 10 years they find a better way to do this so that they won't get this disgraceful critics."
trinityeales,9,Great film,"Great Film, fast paced action packed story! Dakota is great (as always) good acting and looks fab and plays a smart and cool badass character. I don't get why everyone has to be sheep and say its bad for the sake of it!!! This film had an interesting new and original plot and wasn't just the same as every other Marvel or Avengers film of a big battle destroying a whole city for no reason with no plot. I would love them to make a follow up to see where the story goes next and how it potentially ties into a spiderman arch (and which spiderman) but even just another film of the four girl would be super cool!"
tapmantwo-870-867428,6,It's alright,"Just watched for the first time. I'm no comic book buff but I enjoyed this and thought it on a par with other non mu stuff. Dakota Johnson is good in the lead role, and I liked the links to Uncle Ben and Aunt May. I would watch a sequel if it was made, ans it certainly seems well lined up for one - seeing the trio work their way up to super powers would be very interesting.The soundtrack is decent, and the 1990s setting works well anticipating an eventual link to a 2010s Spiderman.People complain too much, if the film is entertaining then surely that's enough - let the stories be told and leave people to enjoy them if they want."
artvillajr-28398,1,Terrible,"Let me keeps this nice and short. The only word that comes to my mind is...TERRIBLE. Absolutely terrible.Respectfully, I don't like to give out my opinion because these people give it there all to make a beautiful film but MY GOD, what in the world did I watch. This film doesn't reach scratch the word ""PERFECT"" AT ALL! I don't like giving reviews but man, I had to creat an account just to say one word, plus it did not even let me type one word because of the word count but this was a terrible, terrible movie.Sony has single handily ruined marvel and my childhood admiration of comics. They should just honestly sell the rights to Spider-Man back, even better just donated back to the MCU.Sony....please stop with this nonsense. I am for ever haunted by this experience it was a complete comedy club at the movie theater watching this ""MaDaMe WeB"" movie."
stevo-95752,1,Worse than even the trailer looked!,"I heard it was bad, but it is simply terrible. Script is awful, editing is atrocious, acting is wooden (they had nothing to work with anyways) and worst of all false advertising. The trailer look like some old school dumb fun with 3 spider girls working with Madame Web, but all that stuff in the trailer is simply a vision of someone and they never get powers.The vilian is terrible and his ""arc"" is ridiculous. He can't even be entertaining in a bad way.Sadly it is not even so bad it's good like Catgirl from 20 years ago. For your own sake, stay away and rewatch The Marvel's on Disney plus. It will be better time spent and cheaper."
r-krishnaprakash,1,Worst film in spider universe,From my childhood I was following all the Spiderman movie. This is one the worst film made in this spider universe even though trailer seems promising I felt like this is going to be a average atleast but while watching the film I felt like cheated and don't want to recommend this one. Save your money. Movie plot is very slow and not engage at all. Character development taken time is very slow and all the main scene shown in the trailer are all showing in movie as shown in trailer. Save your even if you are a Spiderman fan wait for the ott release and can be viewed in it itself . Other than ur.
lucasdacquisto,1,"Dakota Johnson does a ""shockingly"" horrible performance again.","Dakota Johnson in a superhero role as Madame Web had the potential to be well-executed. However, the writer chose to have her character say some of the dumbest lines. For example, in one scene, she walks into a room and the cat wants attention, and she says, 'One sec, cat.' That's just horrible; nobody acts like that. Additionally, Dakota's acting skills were subpar; her crying scene was absolutely awful, and scenes where she had to show emotion looked more comedic than sad. I also didn't feel any love for the characters. The parts where her imagination and her web power interrupted often stuttered, taking away from the actual production. This feels like a complete money grab; the trailer looks great, but the movie is bad."
rottenpotatosoup,1,Madame Web is honestly the worst movie in theaters.,"First of all, the story is a confusing mess of issues and plot holes. The story starts with Constance Webb in the rainforest researching spiders, despite the fact she is heavily pregnant, then she gives birth with the help of some random indigenous spider people who come out of nowhere. Along with that later in the movie despite the fact Cassandra web has a warrant out for her arrest she leaves the country and returns, which is impossible because you will get arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and charged with fleeing justice.Second of all, the production and costumes of the movie are so egregious. The main villain's voice was dubbed so badly, he would open his mouth then three seconds later we were graced with the most basic stereotypical villain dialogue I've ever heard. Another instance of the movie's horrible production was the costumes, the spider people were basically naked wearing wire and red paint which completely disregards the fact they are an isolated tribe in Peru.Some of you are arguing that people should still watch it because it's a women led movie; however, I would counter that just because it's a women centric movie doesn't mean it's deserving of special treatment, and if you really want a good women led movie watch Black Panther: Wakanda Forever."
alizeinibi,1,What a disappointment,"Very lame, they don't give a damn if the movies nowadays make no sense whatsoever...Steal to much from other movies to put it in to this crap movie...Then there is the story what was written by a 12 year old...Then the acting skills are like they just picked them up at Walmart...Excitement: lame
Story:lame
Action:lame
Acting:lame
Originality:lame
Logic:lame
Fun:lameI speed up now and then bc its worst then boring oml like they don't watch it first before they put it out there, it's wast of everyone's time what a joke and jokers are they who put their trust and time in this peace of sh...."
GregTheStopSign95,7,Maybe I'm just too forgiving?,"Yes, this movie could have been a lot better, a lot less thin on story etc...but I still enjoyed it a lot more than most people, so maybe I AM just too forgiving. I'm also a lot easier entertained than a lot of people I know, so there's that...For the cast, I think Dakota Johnson was badly miscast, but then I've never been much of a fan of her. I can't think of a single thing she's made that I've seen. Wait, am I her mother? Am I Melanie Griffith?? But seriously, terrible casting decision. They should have cast an actual actor...on the other hand, I think Mattie, Julia, and Anya were really well cast, and those girls did really well with what LITTLE they were given. Hopefully any potential sequel leans a lot more on them than Cassie. Hopefully they get someone in to write a much better script for any potential sequels, too, because there's a lot of potential for some great sequels/spin-offs.Ben was also really well cast, but then I'm kinda biased because I just love watching Adam Scott work. He may never be any kind of Hollywood A-Lister, but he's already far more interesting to watch than most of that crowd anyway. On the other side of that, though, I think Emma Roberts was badly miscast as Mary. I also think there was no real need to have Mary in as an actual character, though, because all she achieved was to obviously connect this movie to Spider-Man in a way that wasn't really needed. Just like they only referred to Ben's new love interest in a passing mention, they could easily have done the same with Mary. We KNOW by now who Ben is, we KNOW who his new lady is, we KNOW who his brother and SIL are, we didn't need Mary to appear on screen.Ezekiel was an interesting one, though. I only know him very tangentially from the books, and I have no idea what his actual connection to Cassie is in the books, aside from that a connection exists, but I know he was instrumental in one of the (MANY) major shake-ups in Spider-Man lore, so I can't really say whether I think they could have picked a 'better' villain or not. I do think they cast him really well, though. Tahir Rahim was incredible, especially considering what little HE had to work with as well. That seems to be a bit of a pattern with this movie, though. They gave their miscast characters the bulk of the work (or ANY work, as the case may be), and they give their best casting choices the least to work with.As for the actual story, well, there's not really a lot of it here. We've got Flashback + Event, Jump To 'Present', Event, Bad Guy, Trip Down Memory Lane, Showdown. Pretty light on material there. But the couple of action sequences are decent enough, and have a touch of darkness to them, so it's not all bad.I guess maybe the reason I enjoyed it so much was that I know a decent amount of the lore they're working with, and those few actors I mentioned that were really well cast DID do a lot of the heavy lifting...it's never gonna reach the heights of Spidey at this rate, or the first Venom movie, but I enjoyed it a lot more than Venom 2, Morbius, and even some of the MCU movies.Again, I REALLY hope they get better writers for any future sequels, and leave the bulk of the story to characters that are actually played by actors rather than anyone played by Dakota Johnson."
binksbusiness,1,Wish I could see the future to tell myself to not see this movie,"The Hero of the movie is PEPSI! Literally Pepsi kills the villain.Being a huge Spider-Man this is an embarrassment, I prey to God that Sony retires making anything related to Spider-Man. Which sucks because they made such an amazing animated movie series.There is nothing good to say about this movie and my movie theater was LAUGHING at the trauma bonding scene. How bad does the movie have to be when the emotional build up is a joke.""When you take responsibility, Great power will come"" and the dude who says it is so insignificant. Why didn't they give the line to her mother??? And the line completely contradicts from the original saying ""With great power there must also come great responsibility"""
brownm1984,8,Fun film,"This was just a fun watch. I was entertained, laughed, and had an overall enjoyable time watching this film. Are there some plot holes, yes, but it's nice to see a fun Marvel movie. The last few have been so serious and heavy, it's nice to have a lighthearted film to enjoy. I know this isn't going to win an Oscar, I knew going in I wasn't going to cry or be devastated, and that meant a lot to me. If you just want a fun, mindless film, then give this a watch. I actually would love to see a sequel and see where the characters go and see how things continue for them or even get a crossover film with some Spiderman/Venom/Morbius inclusion."
eduardocastroa,7,Undeserved hate,"Madame web has received a lot of hate and resentful comments that in my opinion has been exaggerated, the movie itself is not bad, but it is not good either, of course it is an origin movie and these are always slower to introduce the hero, which is no exception, the villain lacks motivation and does not justify in depth why he does what he does, but in general the movie is fun, it keeps you curious to know what is happening with Cassandra, and how it will solve the events that happen, for me this movie fulfills introducing the characters having an ending to wait for something better and with more action in the future, which is what everyone wanted, in my opiniÃ³n."
justinrakestraw-80171,1,Why even release this?,"I don't understand why this was even released to theaters and not straight to streaming. There's no way Sony or marvel thought this had any chance of being a profitable movie. It's literally worse than "" Morbius"" and ""The Marvels"" which both flopped horribly. This is just soooo bad and I mean Tubi bad. The plot makes no sense. The dubbing has to be the worst I've ever seen in a big budget movie. The whole movie they're just basically running from this guy who's really just defending himself. It just makes no sense. I have to think they just didn't care and figured they'd already spent the money so they might as well get back whatever they can."
lucalucaqwer,1,All-time masterpiece! :),"Madame Web is an unfortunate attempt at filmmaking that falls flat on every conceivable level. From its laughable plot to its cringe-inducing dialogue, this movie manages to disappoint at every turn.The storyline, if one can even call it that, is an incomprehensible mess. Characters stumble through poorly constructed scenes with no clear direction or purpose, leaving the audience utterly bewildered and uninvested. It's as if the filmmakers threw darts at a board filled with clichÃ©s and attempted to string together whatever they hit.The performances are equally abysmal, with actors delivering lines with all the emotion and conviction of cardboard cutouts. It's hard to blame them entirely, though, when the script they're working with is filled with such stilted and nonsensical dialogue. One can only imagine the embarrassment they must have felt delivering lines that wouldn't even pass muster in a high school play.Even the technical aspects of the film are a disaster. The cinematography is uninspired, the editing is choppy and disjointed, and the soundtrack feels like it was thrown together in a hurry from a collection of stock music.In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a forgettable mess of a film that offers nothing of value to its audience. Save yourself the agony and skip this one altogether."
kosmasp,5,Sticking to it,"No pun intended - and even if we have Marvel characters (or characters based on the Marvel universe/comics ...): this is not MCU canon. So all the summary line you may have read about this being the worst Marvel movie and so forth ... well take that with a grain of salt.I really wanted to like it and it does have quite a few nice things going for it - the main cast. Though they do not have much to do to be honest ... can't wait for the Pitch Meeting for this one (in two days we'll be getting it). So many other things that just are wrong and feel wrong too. Even one of the sweetest moments, where I almost choked ... got ruined by additional (explanatory) dialog that was totally not necessary.Suspend your disbelief and go with the flow I reckon. Sony is able to do good Marvel movies (see their animated outline). Not sure what goes wrong with these ... real life ones. And picking the actresses is not fair either - there is not much they could have done. Even the planting and seeding feels ... well bad.Shame because this seemed to be a different kind of superhero movie. You are not alone ... neither is Sydnee Sweeney, who has shown she can act - see Reality."
speaktohihoney,1,I just wish I could go lower than 1 star,"This is literally the worst movie ive ever seen in my life.Some of the terrible reviews ive seen were actually too nice.You know films like sharknado and pirhana where they're that bad they're hilarious and kinda fun to watch? Yeah this isn't like that, it's more like dragging your balls on a cheese grater bad. I actually felt awkward watching it.This movie makes 'Morbius' look like The Shawkshank Redemption.Ive seen better acting from Bruno Hernandes when he throws himself in the 18 yard box.The dialogue is as awkward as a first date with a girl who's cat you've just hit with a bmx."
romanosdaniel,1,"La Luna has competition and it's from the ""mainstream""","I love the concept of the film La Luna. Not the plot or the production values which were all utterly devoid of anything that could be defined as a standard, I mean the concept of a film that is so utterly bad that it actually becomes a cult classic.This film, Madame Web, will certainly give La Luna a run for its money. As others have said, this makes Morbius (previously by far the absolutely worst Marvel type movie of all time) look like Endgame. This movie is like Babylon 5 without any of the good bits. I could go on, but really there isn't much more to say.The acting itself is so bad that I genuinely believe I could have personally replaced more than one of those actors in terms of performance. The best thing that this has going for it is that the ladies are fairly pretty but again that's it.I fell asleep during La Luna and confess that I fell asleep during this particular movie as well. I would give some spoilers except it was so utterly boring I am finding it difficulty to not anything worth spoiling.You are indeed, ""going to watch it twice"" because sometime in around 3 decades you are going to have to watch it again to confirm to yourself that it really was as bad as you remember it...."
lanaplavsic,5,Underwhelming coming from Marvel,"Honestly, the marketing for this movie was done really good. Acting has been amazing, Dakota always does a good job acting as a confused person who has a particular power. The other actors and actresses have done a great job also, especially Sydney Sweeny who was also filming another movie where she is completely different character. She is a great talent and that had to be mentonied. Speaking of acting, everyone did a great job.Camera sector now. There was so many confusing shots with a lot of unnecessary zoom-ins, speaking for example about the intense scene in forest in the begging of the movie, or when Cassie her last words to the bad guy. I think the scenes were pretty intense and adding the intensity with a camera zoom was just a bit to much. Also there was too much crooked shots with a bad guy that it lost it's meaning. It would probably have way more power if the shots were normal, and only in the most meaningful shot it was crooked, or maybe it is unnecessary at all because we became aware of how dangerous the was at the beginning of the movie. There were other kinda confusing shots but it doesn't really matter because the character was confused as well so it did justice to a story.Editing and animation was overall amazing, but marvel has set the bar high with the earlier movies. Marvel movies depent of quality of animation witch is always amazing and aways deliveres to a full potential.Sound sector was also a bit off-putting at a times. There were times were it feet like charachers mount and sound weren't synchronized, maybe for two lines. The thing i liked a lot is conecting a vision to a song by Britney Spears- amazing idea! Not only visions through a visual representation, inseas create it trough another sense. Loved that one!Also the sponsors made sure we know who sponsors are haha!Anyways, the ending isn't the end. We see that there is gonna be more movies so this is probably a introduction to them. Besides that, now marvel has many ways that they could develop stories, let's hope they do good!ALSO JUST A WARNING- THERE IS NO POST CREDIS SCENE. EVERYONE WAS EXTREMELY SUPRISED. (Correct me if I'm wrong and that was a case just in my cinema in NewOrleans)"
super16g,7,A decent origin story.,"This movie did not deserve the hate it got. It is an origin story for Madame Web, not the three spider women she spent the whole run time protecting. I guess people went in thinking they were going to watch Sidney Sweeney in spandex beating up a room full of thugs and lifting cars and were disappointed. What we got is a mystery thrill ride with a relentless villain versus regular people and one woman with precognitive abilities trying to figure things out. The character drama of the four being thrown together under unique and strange circumstances and coming together as a makeshift family IS the movie. It is not and never was going to be a 200M computer generated explosion fest for the eyes and ears, it is about the beginning of a family of super powered people before they get their powers."
marinamexias,3,"The web of bad superhero movies, unfortunately attacks again","I'm not exaggerating when I write that I have no idea how on earth this script was approved, I'm trying very hard to squeeze some good things to talk about, I'm having difficulties.""Madame Web"" is a movie that all of us superhero's enthusiasts were expecting and rooting to be good, her arc at the comics is such a rich and interesting story that I personally was expecting to see on screen.I was shocked in how fast the movie went out of a solid 6 to a 3/2. It's honestly impressive.Until she has the ambulance crash vison that her friend dies, I will be very honest that I was intrigued and not hating at all the individual story of Cassie Webb. After that the movie started to lose me for good. In particular when the three girls were introduced, they were so poorly introduced and poorly continued in the movie that it's honestly impressive again.I'm not even gonna talk about the CGI (specially, the underwater scenes ) or the dialog quality bc lately this problems have been super frequent in this genre. But the plot holes were too much to handle ðŸ˜­ and the embarrassing fight scenes were just enough for me to wanna leave the cinema.They managed to do a superhero movie without a superhero and putting Emma Roberts as a ""wannabe comic relief"" when she could offer so much more!!!!! And Dakota, Sydney, Isabela and Celeste could've done so much with a decent script.The thing is, the big studios, don't learn ever that a good superhero movie doesn't have a formula to copy and paste and a superhero movie REQUIRES A SUPERHERO!!!They made ""Morbius"" a friend to make company in down tier of ""Movies that I'd like to be able to erase from my mind""."
cnh-95573,8,This Is A Good Movie,"So, I've learned not to listen to reviews because people are often over judgemental about movies that I enjoy.I came into this with no expectations as I'm not familiar with the character.As a fan of movies I enjoyed this one from beginning to end just as it was. Without overthinking it or over analyzing it.It wasn't perfect but no movie is. It is a solid 8 because it held my attention and I found myself not focusing on anything else while it was on because I wanted to see what was going to happen next.The fun part of the movie is that Madame Web can predict a few minutes into the future. One thing that made it a bit different is that the main character was an unwilling participant. She didn't want to help these girls but she did and she struggled with it throughout the movie.I wish I had seen more of her powers or that she had more powers. I also wish they would have explained how the girls received their powers and what they were.If you're expecting full on action, a spider man type movie then yeah you won't enjoy this very much. But if you're looking for a movie with a good story and character who you are rooting for then you may just like this.It's definitely not a 3.7. I'd say a 7 at the very least but I gave it an 8.Give it a try, you may just find yourself pleasantly surprised."
cahidi,6,Madame Future,"I'd probably gonna get lots of dislikes fro writing this, seeing how everybody seems to hate this movie. But I don't think this movie is a complete trash. I think that the reason why everybody's been salty about this movie is because they're hoping to see a superhero movie. And of course, it is a superhero movie, so it's only natural. So I treated it differently, I don't consider it as a superhero movie, but as a drama, mystery, thriller movie. And the result is pretty good. My only complaint about it is that they didn't show more of the three girls' future. Cause let's face it, there isn't much to see from Cassie. Oh, and it's also annoying to see the camera moving around so much while the action was on. It's making me harder to understand what's going on."
bhernandez2216,4,"It was okay, but not that good","I finally got to watch Madame Web, and I gotta be honest, I feel really bad for actresses and actors for this movie tho. I think it's the movie itself that didn't do very well, and Sony needs to pull themselves together and make a really good or better movies, if they wanna make money at the box office for sure.Don't get me wrong, I love Dakota Johnson, I thought she did a pretty good job with her part, Sydney Sweeney was beautifully fantastic and gorgeous, Isabela Merced was so stunning and Celeste O'Connor was pretty cool, but there was really bad script writing and the dialogue and the story was not that good like I thought it would be.So I'm gonna have to agree with my own opinion that Madame Web is way worse than Morbius. They probably share the same vibes with every memes and with really bad ideas they added to the characters of their own. So..... for me it was an okay Marvel film.5/10."
vperez714,3,The worst comic book movie I've seen this year,"I was looking forward to see Madame Web that I was expected to like it, but now I hated it.Madame Web is basically a gimmick than a comic book origin story movie. It's like a psychological horror thriller movie that reminds me of Final Destination.Although, the movie does have an interesting setting, intriguing visuals, and a cool soundtrack, but the characters were shallow, the dialogue is very laughable of a terrible script, the action sequences is just tired old clichÃ©s, and a confusing storyline of a predictable plot with a silly premise.I found Madame Web is a major disappointment because the movie is not original as a comic book origin story just like Halle Berry from Catwoman. Dakota Johnson is so tiresome and tedious of her characterization as the main lead in this movie. I think it's the worst comic book movie I've seen this year."
migsalzanobackup,3,An expected disaster,"Another mediocre and disastrous addition to Sony's horrendous heroes cinematic universe. I was hoping for an evolution after the unbearable ""movie"" Morbius, but here we seem to see the same mistakes as its predecessor. An uninteresting mess to watch.A script that doesn't even try to be innovative, with a first act that doesn't offer much in the way of innovation, a second act that lacks development and a third act where we see the whole mess come together in the most disastrous way possible.Madame Web often tries to sell itself on fan service, relying on dialog that often adds nothing to the film."
markhelmy,1,A rubbish pepsi advert.,"Honestly this film is appalling. How it ever got made is beyond me. The acting is terrible, the writing is worse and the whole direction is atrocious.I left the cinema not really understanding the point of any of it. I didn't care about the main character and she came across as being very unlikable. I didn't care about her backstory. I didn't really understand the point of the three girls in the film and the villain was absolutely terrible. He made absolutely no sense and there was no real explanation given for why he was the way he was. He was just a ""bad man"" with no depth.The whole film was so comically bad that the three people next to me in the cinema were cackling with laughter the whole way through. Scenes that we're supposed to be serious came across as being unbelievably corny. And there's even a terrible reference to with great power comes great responsibility that gets completely butchered!As I also referred in the title of this review the whole film is nothing but a cheesy product placement exercise. The amount of Pepsi in this film is insane and it's not subtle whatsoever. Characters are seen holding Pepsi cans with a Pepsi logo faced towards the camera, there are Pepsi adverts littered throughout the film and the big sequence at the end of the film contains a huge Pepsi neon sign. They're also Calvin Klein adverts and other not so subtle product placements throughout the film. It's done very poorly and is incredibly distracting. Again this got laughs from the other people in the cinema.To conclude I really don't understand why this film was made, I don't understand why you'd want to see it and I'd highly recommend no one paying money to go and watch it at the cinema. It's just bad and not in a redeeming way like the room."
pinkie-85404,1,TRASH!,"Most horrible superhero movie Marvel ever made! Do NOT waste your time! I can't believe I actually sat down and watched this garbage! I can't get my life back and now I regret it! There's absolutely no substance to this movie in the first hour and 15 minutes is literally nothing happening! I can't even believe they wasted thousands of dollars on this garbage! And the acting is freaking horrible! I am so mad! I fell asleep like 15 times trying to get through it and I realize why I couldn't the first five times! I should have just quit there, But I was trying to give it a chance! This is so disappointing."
pederhastrup,5,A lot of hate.,"There is a lot of hate for this movie but in reality is not that bad.But 35% giving it 1 star is just stupid or so lucky they only watch great movies before.The story is pretty good trying to do something new, but it never really hit the right note to take it to any place great or interesting and it fall flat.If one of the girls had been on the bad guys site it cut have made a twist so the story did not become so predictable.Something to make anything happen would have been a good idea.The 2 thing people keep hitting on is. The 3 teens going to get something to eat, kinda make sense if you did not know the one who says she saved you.And the fight on the Pepsi sign was kinda boring but not as bad a marketing stunt as there are in most american movies."
jillbird2401-705-379377,7,Fun to watch!,"I read the reviews and went in with very low expectations. We enjoyed this movie and thought the cast was good. Sure there were lots of holes, but that can be said for any movie. I could care less about the comics and basically wanted to watch a fun action movie. Dakota Johnson is just the right amount of awkward to pull this role off. This isn't a movie I would watch over and over like Avengers but still a fun watch nonetheless. Don't listen to all the haters and go in with zero expectations. I am a big believer that the first movie of a series are always poor. Take for Instance Thor 1 and 2 awful but 3 was fantastic!"
lokithepsycho,2,i never knew a sony production could be so bad,"How did this even get greenlit? I read that it went through lots of rewrites which always dooms films, it feels like a group of feminists got together and tried to make spider-man look weak compared to them ""spider-women"" that didnt really do anything apart from be whiny and tortured souls which all 3 coincidentally were...
The main actress didnt really act that well either, her lines felt rushed and the scenes were all over the place, they killed off mike epps straight away who felt out of place without his comedic self, the only person that actually acted well was adam scott who is very talented anyway, cant remember the name of the main actress but she is beautiful, thats it from her though lol i think she had a really bad scrip. The CGI was terrible too, when the knock off spider-man was jumping around and crawling on ceilings i was shocked by how bad it looked, like something from 2005.The end though was laughable so heres a spoiler alertShe goes blind, and then ends up in an electric wheelchair where her whole persona changes and she starts speaking like a female professor X i kid you not, her acting is very bad, its like a sketch from key and peele, god knows what they were thinking.The only good thing about the film was the beginning, basically the origin storyOh, and they fully ripoff peter parkers uncle bens speech ""with great power comes great responsibility"" basically changing it around.Apart from the start, the whole thing felt like it was written by a feminist college student that has too much money to waste lol.I didnt think a super hero film could get worser than ""The Marvels""Sony just needs to give disney full rights to all the spider-verse characters before they destroy the whole legacy because sony allows too many amateurs to make these poor films.All in all, the film has an interesting premise but poorly executed with bad direction, bad CGI, bad casting, poor scripts and boring pacing. I give this 2.5/10."
cassidyblay,8,Ignore the reviews and watch for a good time!,"I don't get the low ratings. It's ridiculous that people say this is the worst movie of the year. What are you talking about? I genuinely enjoyed every single part of this movie. From the cast, to the storyline, to the setting, to the pace, everything was on point. I see it as just a light hearted feel good kind of superhero movie. Totally enjoyed. I almost didn't watch it because of the bad ratings snd reviews here but I'm glad I watched it. It was a really fun watch. I bet most people dubbing this as the worst movie of the year probably didn't watch it or expected something so extravagant. Not every movie needs to be mind blowing. Sometimes, we just need to sit, watch and enjoy a pleasantly put together movie."
reedhi-20496,6,Bad in a fun way,"Don't get me wrong this movie sucked, but it was fun at the same time. Bad pacing writing and story but it was still fun to watch and I feel like that's all that matters. Not everything has to have an amazing story to be a fun movie. It seems like it took inspiration from final destination with the premonition stuff. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have fun while watching this movie. It's not an absolute masterpiece but not everything is. It's also not an absolutely horrible movie. The thing I keep saying in this review is that it's a fun movie and that's all that should matter. Not everything from Marvel is going to be an endgame level movie."
dianefy-56452,2,Seriously how film this to torture people,"The only part in this movie i can relate is that I want to have the same power so i can kill myself before i go through this mental trauma. This movie is such a disaster that I'm too exhausted to even start criticizing it. Haven't seen such a flat and uninspiring villain in 20 years. Every character reeks of the screenwriter's overflowing clichés. It's bizarre - isn't the screenwriter human? Have they never been a teenager? How could they write such idiotic, passive, zombie-like teens? I can't even remember the names of three characters. The whole plot is a mess, doesn't hold up under the slightest scrutiny. What's even wrong with the villain? If there's an issue, why not show it properly? The abrupt emotional scenes between the lead and her mother, what's the point? And the atrocious audio-visuals, makeup, God, your 'cool poses' are anything but cool, just painfully awkward. There are too many flaws to count. I'm genuinely baffled. I think the screenwriter and director should seriously consider not making films for anyone ever again."
lethaltare,4,Who asked for Madame Web?,"I am honestly incredibly curious to know who wanted a Madame Web Movie?The movie has some interesting moments, the origin story of Madame Web opens up quite well, however also bizarre in a way. ""Spider People"" just takes away from that.Tahar Rahim who play Ezekiel Sims is one of the worst actors I've even come across. His voice throughout the movie is like it is being dubbed, it's out of sync and his mouth doesn't move correctly, and his voice is just dull.The pacing of the film is all over the place and has extremely loud flashback moments which is far too intense for what they are.Dakota Johnson is the only saving grace in this movie, and that's quite a surprise to me considering she hasn't really done any movies worth talking about except the Social Network. Still, this really wasn't hard to do considering the rest of the case seem misplaced as child/teen characters.The story had potential to be interesting but gives up halfway through. It's very dull, and has no memorable moments. I would not recommend watching this movie if you have to pay for it, if it's free and you have nothing else to watch then web yourself up for a boring time.I've only give it 4 stars for 4 things I liked throughout the film, but to be honest this could be a 1.1) Back Story/Origin Story
2) Adam Scott
3)Sydney Sweeney
4) It ends."
hoangdeptrai-82182,1,One of the movies,"I have made this account on IMDB to write a review expressing my opinion of the movie titled Madame Web. There were characters including a protagonist, an antagonist and some supporting characters, there were scenes that were recorded with a camera, there was a plot written by the screenwriters and directors, there was acting performed by the actors (my favourite is when Cassie goes ""it's webbin time"" and webbed everybody) and there were sound effects and music edited in by the producers. Overall, I would consider it to be a movie made by Marvel in 2024. One of the movies ever made since Morbius, even. I suspect this film will get one webillion dollars soon."
silviaflorina,5,well...,"The plot seems promising, but the characters and the lines and the way it was filmed...well, let's just say the actors have much more potential than this movie. But overall, I wasn't bored, just cringed.Most of the behaviour and the lines of the villain were cringe af and did not sound scary or threatening at all, just sounded like a villain in a child's animation, or worse. I think that was the main problem, that we didn't feel thrilled at all by the bad people.And also, many of the ""superheroic"" actions were not believable.I mean, I've seen way worse movies than this one in the past few years, so I guess it deserves a 5, tho."
CinemaAmazing,4,A Cinematic Disaster Event,"Yesterday I had the opportunity to see ""Madame Web"" and, yes, it is one of the worst films of the year, but it was still a cinematic event. It was camp, the film tries to take itself so seriously that it ends up being an unexpected comedy.The script is so horrible and the direction is so pointless that you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen.The entire cast is so bad that it ends up being entertaining.The visual effects are of even lower quality than tv shows...
I recommend everyone to watch the film at least once in their lives and then erase it from their memories forever.#protectbadcinema."
tsora-90756,4,Hardly a superhero movie,"Going into this I did not have huge expectations. The trailer did little to garner interest for myself and I assumed it would be just another fade into the background superhero movie. Well I can say it did at least stand out a bit, but not in a good way.The acting was just miserable. Dakotas jokes made were cringy a majority of the movie, Sydney's character lacked any trace of intelligence, and the rest of the characters were just kind of... there. Emma Robert's additionally did not even need to be in this, her role served little to no purpose besides further plot expansion in the late part of the movie, which could have been written in a much more natural and believable way. Whoever wrote the script for this movie needs to make sure they put someone else in charge in the future.Since it's a superhero movie we can always look forward to what we came for, right? Wrong. Cassie's primary power is premonition. This is somewhat cool but definitely is not very showy. She lacks the basic Spider-Man powers of super strength, climbing on walls, or slinging webs. Basically she's a very downgraded version of Spider-Man. Late in the movie she awakens a second power, which was honestly so laughable the entire theater cracked up seeing it happen.The girls that accompany Cassie are seen as having some unique costumes and powers as well though so at least she has some backup, right? Wrong again. They only have these powers (which potentially could have saved this film) during a vision near the beginning of the film, again near the end of the film in another vision, and lastly in the credits. They never possess these powers during the actual film timeline. At this point advertising the movie with them as having had powers just felt like a lie. You could say we will see these powers awaken in a future film based on the ending, but I don't need to be a superhero to have enough premonition to know this won't be picked up for a sequel.Then comes the worst part of it all. The villain. He is just so hard to watch. His acting is cringy at best, his voice was hilarious and felt like it was dubbed at many times of the film, and his motive never even was explained. He said he wished to take revenge for what happened to his family but he never commits to that route. He never takes revenge on those who wronged him, makes a difference for someone else in a similar situation, or sees the error of his ways in how merciless he is in self-preservation. Also he steals a cutting edge government program to hunt down the three girls and has it for the entirety of the film being operated by his side kick at his home. Does the government just not care about getting this back..? The movie is riddled with plot holes and bad decisions by character that lack any true justification.All in all the movie is a good popcorn flick but holds little to make you want to see it in theatres, and even less to justify a rewatch or a sequel. I will give a shoutout to them sticking true to the timeline and having the old fashioned Pepsi branding on Mountain Dew and the Pepsi soda cans though."
kelly_monteith,6,Not as bad as people say,"I think there is a conspiracy against the Sony spider verse succeeding. Madame web was not a great film, but also not as bad as people are portraying it as. It was good introduction to the character.And it's not as bad as some marvel movies, like Thor love and thunder.It was an origin story, the acting was good, the special effects were decent, the villain was memorable, what more do you need for comic Movie.of arc or link to the wider spider verse, maybe a cameo from Peter parker or miles morales.Give the Sony movies a chance I want alternatives to marvel, they've already destroyed Zack snyders DC vision, and now they're doing the same to Sony's spider verse."
sazzad_h_akm,1,Madame Web - A Wasted Opportunity,"If a good movie means a bunch of pretty girls jumping and laughing without reason, then this would be a good one. But we all know that this is not correct. The acting is too poor as much as the script. Please don't waste your precious time trying to watch this wrong movie.While Madame Web may initially captivate with its aesthetic appeal, the charm quickly dissipates, leaving viewers stranded amidst a sea of mediocrity. The promise of an engaging narrative is shattered by lackluster performances and a script that fails to inspire. It's disheartening to witness such potential squandered in a whirlwind of superficiality. Despite the allure of its cast, the film ultimately falls flat, devoid of substance or meaning. Save yourself the disappointment and seek out a cinematic experience worthy of your time."
lyndseylopez,9,Give it a chance it wasn't so bad,"I tell ya people will hate for no reason! Yes, the writing could be a little bit more refined, they definitely needed to do a little bit of editing, but the action was pretty awesome and the Acting was great. Just give it a chance. The special effects are great. It was definitely better than Amber Heard's acting in Aquaman.It's definitely better than some movies that are out there definitely better than Captain Marvel but I'm serious. Give it a chance. Don't knock it until you've seen it.I completely believe that a lot of the hate that this film has been getting is because it's led by an all female cast."
FeastMode,7,With great responsibility comes great power,"Am I the only person who likes this movie? It seems like the consensus is that it's awful and will be on most people's worst of the year list. The thing is... I don't care. I've seen thousands of movies and am confident in my opinion. Even if everyone says it's bad, I like what I like. Want proof? The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the one that got the series cancelled and rights sold to Disney, is still my favorite Spider-Man movie (9 stars).Madame Web starts off like a typical, bland superhero flick. But it keeps getting better and more entertaining as it goes on. It has some cool action, a good musical score, and a beastly villain. They do a great job with a lesser-known character, one whose power seems impossible to translate to live-action.There are a couple of scenes later in the movie that gave me goosebumps. And I left the theater in a great mood. This is 10,000 times better than Morbius. It may not be high-quality cinema, but I found it thoroughly enjoyable.(1 viewing, opening Wednesday UltraScreen 2/14/2024)"
jens-257,2,What even is this? and why do they keep doing this?,"""Cassandra's Sight"" plunges into the overexploited urban fantasy genre with a premise that teeters on the edge of intrigue and cliché. Cassandra Webb, a New York City paramedic, embodies the trope of an unwitting hero thrust into the supernatural. Her emerging clairvoyant abilities, rather than adding depth, serve as a convenient plot device that feels both forced and underdeveloped.The film's attempt to weave together the personal journey of self-discovery with the high stakes of protecting three young women from a nebulous ""deadly adversary"" falls flat. The antagonist, lacking both motive and menace, fails to evoke the necessary tension, turning what could have been a gripping conflict into a lackluster chase.Directorial decisions and screenplay choices prompt a recurring question: ""What even is this?"" The narrative, punctuated by predictable plot twists and expository dialogue, seems to underestimate its audience's intelligence. Furthermore, the film's reliance on visual effects over character development and coherent storytelling exacerbates its shortcomings.The true mystery of ""Cassandra's Sight"" is not found within its supernatural elements but in its production. The industry's persistence in churning out formulaic narratives that have historically underperformed is baffling. One wonders how such projects continue to receive the green light, ignoring the clear signals from audiences seeking originality and substance.In conclusion, ""Cassandra's Sight"" serves as a stark reminder of the creative bankruptcy plaguing certain sectors of the film industry. Its failure to engage or innovate begs the question: how can they keep doing this, knowing it always fails? The film, unfortunately, adds to the pile of missed opportunities where potential for innovation is sacrificed for the safety of the familiar, yet unsuccessful, formulas."
batantx,1,Thankfuly I did not pay for it,"Sometimes Pirating movies is wrong. Sometimes it's the only way from being robbed by Hollywierd by their complete waste of time films.This movie falls in the latter category!There is not a single character in this film that does not feel like some card board cutout. In fact not a single one of the female characters has any unique personality. Its like the writers wrote one female part then chopped that single part into four character that are all basically the same.This movie is bad! It makes ""The Room"" look like a riveting suspenseful adrenaline rush.Its almost like the production companies are intentionally trying to release subpar snooze fests that make a trip to the dentist a more enjoyable alternative."

They looks like they read something out of the book directly.. does the director/ wroter dont give them permission to improvise? They looks so weird.. i can say that the actor confused and troubled by the script so they cant act well...Also whats with the plot? So random.. so many jumps.... At first i thought it was new final destination movies, also whats with random 2000's teen songs? Whats with the easter egg? The movies try so hard to be edgy but i cant even enjoy it...The enemy is so mediocre, the fight is a meh, i dont even interested at all with the enemie and dont even remember their name...unlike other enemies in other movies..i mean.. the enemie also have superpower right?

CinemaSerf,5,Madame Web,"We start off with an heavily pregnant woman deep in the Peruvian jungle looking for a very rare spider with her pal ""Ezekiel"" (Tahar Rahim). Guess what? Yep - she finds it, and almost immediately too! Anyway, it turns out that her pal isn't so friendly after all and pretty sharpish she is shot and face up in a pool of healing waters where her baby is being delivered by a jungle people with spidey-skills. Advance twenty-odd years and we meet paramedic ""Cassie"" (Dakota Johnson) who drives around with her partner ""Ben"" (Adam Scott), indifferently saving folks from disaster. It's one such disaster, though, that sees her tumbled deep into the river and having to be rescued by her buddy. This trauma appears to trigger something weird. She is getting flash-fronts. She can see the tiniest snippets of the future - and that doesn't usually bode well for anyone, including her! A trip on a train to a funeral proves decisive as three of the other passengers also feature in her dreams - all being the targets of a mysterious lycra-clad tunnel-climber bent on slaughter. Can she rescue them and find out just what's going on? Well possibly, but the story is just thin and the characters so undercooked that I didn't really care. The whole arachnid story line is under-developed to the point that I couldn't see what her skills really had to do with a spider at all. Tahar Rahim seemed uncertain if he was supposed to be ""Deadpool"" and/or Antonio Banderas and hats have to come off to Celeste O'Connor for playing the entirely obnoxious and attitudinal ""Mattie"" with quite such aplomb. The denouement is straight out of ""Highlander"" (1986) and I'm afraid that rather summed this up. Not an original bone in it's small and squidgy body, over-scripted and made for the sake of it. Sure, it's all about team bonding, trust and finding yourself (quite literally), but the readiness with which all concerned buy into this increasingly repetitive and whacky scenario is just daft. Like the whole multi-verse concept, the studios have decided to take super-hero films and flog them to death without worrying about concept, character or a decent story, and though Johnson does try to lift this where she can, it's ends up being something akin to one of those ""Superman"" television episodes we used to watch with Dean Cain - only with monotonous time-shifting!"
bunty-chauhan12,1,"As expected, it is crap :)","Poor storyline, poor casting, poor direction in addition to all the other poor things this movie is the epitome of grade-A Hollywood garbage. If there was one thing in this universe which wasn't required, it was this. Also, what do you get when you hire two actresses who have absolutely no actual skill/knowledge of acting other than nudity. If you have a brain then I'd suggest to skip this one so that you can save yourself from the brain damage you'll get after watching this load of crap.I want to write a lot of things but I think I have summarised it enough. Nothing more to say, cheers!!!!!"
mcdibyoe,1,Only watch if you want to fall asleep.,"Seriously, this is one heck of a movie, and I mean it in a bad way.Boring plot, not enough action, too much drama, and slow as snail pace. You can even sleep and not missing anything.This could have been a hit, if the writer went to the other direction, and I mean the RIGHT direction. Superhero movies were always aimed at boys, not girls. Sure some girls like it, but the core audience is always boys and men.The only saving grace of this crap is Dakota Johnson. I'm not saying she played good in this movie, but at least she's easy for the eyes.If you want to watch a superhero movie, go for another binge of avengers, spider-man, dark knight trilogy or whatever.Avoid this piece like the plaque.Don't say I didn't warn you guys."
yamihanakootaku,6,"It's okay, enjoyable.","This movie is not the greatest superhero movie of all times and not the worst either; not worst than Morbius, that' s for sure.I went with little knowledge about how the characters portrayed in the film are developed in the comics and the plot was interesting enough for me to follow. There were a couple of easter eggs for spider-man's fans and the actresses do their best with the material so in the end I didn't find it as boring as I was fearing at all. I enjoyed it.The few action scenes are scattered and mostly okay, but don't go in there hoping to see crazy stunts because you won't find them. There's no awful CGI that hurts your eyes (Flash, I'm looking at you) as far as I could tell."
yannickleonard-77275,1,A total waste of ti e!!,"The idea was good, but the movie itself was incredibly boring..... I kept looking at time hoping it was finally over.... I was actually anxious to see it, but I almost left before the end.... Story had so much potential, kept hoping it would pick up and get going but it didn't....most exciting parts were some boring car chases, they keep working on the origin to present the characters but the movie seem to actually begin in the last 2 minutes.. major let down..the story had so much potential, they could have wrapped up the origin part, but To be honest, if they make a sequel, and it's a BIG if, I will most likely pass on it,, sorry to say but manage your expectations and wait to see it at home, not worth the price and time to go see it on the big screen....."
qjdqn,8,This is solid 8-marvel movie with storyline,"These guys giving it 1 start shows you that now the majority of cinema going crowd are idiots and anything smart is rated down. The laxt 5-6 marvel movies have been a mess no storyline pathetic children movies , i have grownup with spiderman 1 and so on and there are very few superhero movies with a storyline and this one had a decent plot and was quite good -8/10 is fair enough.It is a captivating journey into the mystical realms of the Spider-Verse. With its intricate storytelling and rich character development, this film offers a fresh perspective on the iconic Spider-Man universe. From its stunning visual effects to its powerful performances, Madame Web keeps audiences on the edge of their seats from start to finish. A must-watch for both die-hard fans and newcomers alike, it's a cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression."""
javoegele,6,Fun B Movie!,"I went to see this with my wife expecting to see something ""So Bad it was Good"" like Troll 2 or The Room. I was psyched based on how the internet was reacting. I thought I must see this in the theater to be a part of this cultural moment. I was extremely dissapointed to learn I was actually enjoying this film just for being a fun B movie. Sure there was camp, and head scratching moments where I wondered how certain choices were made but ultimately I enjoyed the action, the characters, the cool costumes...Tight super hero costumes on beautiful women. I had a great time and my wife loved it too. Total reccomend for a fun date night."

The girls constantly screaming like little kids can make even the strongest man cry with misery.The dancing on a table in a diner was an extra stupid addition.All in all, giving it a 1 rating was to generous.I'm pretty sure this completely ruined what might have been left of Dakota Johnson's ""career"". She should probably take up bartending or waitressing.Please don't do this to yourself."

This movie is just full of Pepsi everywhere, like barf. I mean c'mon people, why not make the whole movie about Pepsi instead of this awefull movie with the WORST story, acting etc EVER.This is an insult to any Marvel movie ever made. Look i loved Dakota Johnson in 50 Shades of Grey, and i kinda liked the dead pan acting from Sydney Sweeney in The White Lotus but this is a no-no as in NEVER wacth this movie. I dont want to spoiler anything but this was just a pure let down from the get go. But yk, just decide for yourself."
lornak-18008,4,Started Good But...No,"I thought it was going to be good when it first started. About halfway through I decided it must have been made for children because no way was it a movie for adults. It was just too cringy to be for adults. But with the amount of violence involved it wasn't for children either. Turns out, it's really not for anyone. Sorry to say this because there is a decent cast, but I think the writers are the ones at fault here. Probably the director as well. I did like Dakota Johnson's character, it's too bad she didn't have a better written part to play. Her teenage charges? They just needed discipline and the ability to listen and grow up! I'm surprised she didn't drop them off at a police station. All part of the pretty ridiculous plot. This is one I should have skipped."
silicontourist,2,Not a terrible film but it very boring...IMHO,"It wasn't the best, or worst, film so far in 2024 but, I must say that it just plain bored me to tears. According to some of the reviewers here we are apparently not allowed to give it a low score, or say that it was disliked etc. It still does not give them the right to be rude because people disagree with them.Anyway! I am digressing here. The most boring thing about the film was definitely the 3 girls that, Madame Web was tasked to protect. To me there was no excitement, no build up to tense moments etc and a lifeless script. I had started to view it and had to force myself to keep on till the end; which I was very relieved to reach when it arrived. I don't think there will be a sequel to it but if there is, I will not be watching it.Its a case of see it for yourself and decide about it. I would just ignore the reviews and go with your own feelings on it!"
wiitaman,1,No one asked for this movie.,"Poor writing, definitely not great acting. Sony, please stop trying to write marvel content. I'll admit into/across the spiderverse are good. But this is pitiful. If you didn't sell this garbage to Netflix I definitely wouldn't have watched because again, no one asked for this. Wowza they ask for a lot of info to post a review. Dakota Johnson: not believable in the role. Writing is absolutely terrible. CGI is somehow worse than spiderman movies from 20 years ago. Again to Sony, please sell your stake in this because this has to be the worst movie made with the Marvel name. Still trying to make this long enough to post. ðŸ’©"
anyanimeotoho,3,I initially thought there was some form of prejudice behind the bad reviews...,"No. This movie is just soulless. Between the robotic script, the confusing cinematography, the weak rapport among the main characters and the melodramatic pacing, this is a slow-burn dumpster fire. Over a runtime of nearly two hours, we're fed the origin story of a group of characters who never manage to connect to the audience. They're stereotyped to comic extents without ever managing to be relatable or elicit empathy with their carefully -- or carelessly, depending on how you see it -- constructed backstories. ""Madame Web"" spends so much time constructing its narrative around a boring villain who sometimes sounds like he's struggling to be intelligible. The movie then presents the most in-your-face epilogue montage indicating the promise of a sequel, after succeeding at giving none of its main characters any identity beyond a shared trauma. Despite all the curiously bad choices made in the execution of this film, it still manages to be boring in moments. Appallingly written, poorly shot, and generally poorly executed in many aspects. How do you greenlight this? WHAT WAS THE VISION? I can't tell."
donnodcassandra-41099,6,OK now I had low expectations already,"Well I didn't disliked it . I will better start with what I liked , all the scenes with the cassie's mother and then all scenes with Cassie alone without the spider girls , I liked cassies powers and the ending they gave her ( gives a little bit like professor x vibes) and the villain ( he wasn't the best marvel villain but not the worst) what I didn't like , the spider girls and the fact that it had more of Cassius life before everything started and then only action , I wanted more story so I can connect more with the characters and then some action , now Dakota did actually a nice job since the character has that kind of emotionless and awkward type of character but the emotional scenes where not so bad.Again I had already low expectations."
rczgpzy,2,It's an OK movie,This may contain spoilers?It is its own movie . If you like a movie with lots of action this is a movie for you. If you like a movie that repeats itself . That repeats itself. If you like a movie that repeats itself this is a film for you . This movie has pointless side characters. The main character is useless. The antagonist was rushed . No plot point for the whole movie all around . I only went for the clips in the trailer . Let me tell you . False advertisement. Movie has no spiderwomen in it . If it do it's a blink and you'll miss it . I'd say all together those scenes last less than 2 minutes . Which was only I believe 2 to three scenes max .
timothyraymond-85078,8,Certified Hallmark Movie,"Madame Web is a Hallmark movie of the super hero genre. And for us early stage ""Boomers"", that works extremely well.Sometimes all of us get caught up in source material, production levels, and admittingly all of the necessary things required for a quality movie. But every once in a while just to have a story told in an overly simplistic manner can be the ride you may not have expected but given a chance it can be one to enjoy.Yes, you know exactly what's going to happen next and yes, the predictability level has no ceiling. But sometimes campy, low level fruit can be just as fulfilling as the highend stuff. Every once in a blue moon, take off the austere that permiates the movie industry (especially in places like the MCU) and enjoy something that has just a tiny bit of sparkle. Madame Web did that for us tonight. My wife and I enjoyed the ride and would love to see the next chapter of their story."
HardyReviews_,6,MADAME WEB IS NOT THAT BAD,"Madame Web starts off weak with its pacing but comes back strong and resolves some of its major issues. This film still has its occasional struggles with CGI but what super hero movie doesn't have that. There are some corny lines and some really interesting acting choices, but with this being said, the movie is not that bad. This movie comes back strong after some of its struggles and creates a fun and interesting story with a nice premise to the introduction of Madame Web and the beginning of a possible live-action spiderverse film series. This is not a spider-man film, there is not action in the sense like a spider-man film so please do not come into this thinking their is going to be intense action, but the action that is there, works well for this movie."
benjimerritt,3,So bad I had to leave a review,"Extremely slow, spotty plot with high school play type acting. Dakota doesn't bring enough star power to carry this movie, and the story line doesn't move at all.The writing and dialog for the actors move along as if they don't the English language. The lines are very basic in nature, and the attempts at humor are missed. Even Mike Epps plays it straight faced instead of being hilarious as we all know he can be.The most annoying qualities is that the main character tries to act like their Mother while being bitter about her parents. It's also a crazy jump that they ALL have broken home stories in common.This movie is really terrible."
djrmc24,1,I'm embarrassed for everyone involved here.,"Madame Web is one of the most amateurish films made that I have witnessed in recent memory. I mean I am very embarrassed for all that were involved with this film from the Director, Studio Heads, and actors. This movie was shot very poorly with very bad dialogue and script. I can't even say I enjoyed one scene at least because I didn't. I kept checking my watch to see how much time I lost watching this movie. The actresses and actors here are good in other films just not in this. This Marvel character should have never been given a solo film but instead I feel should have been included a little in maybe the next Spider-Man film. Our lead characters don't even get to wear any of their Superhero costumes here but instead is shown in a quick action sequence at beginning and ending of film. I also hated the fact that they created a little backstory here with Peter Parker's uncle and mom. Sony what are you doing?! Just concentrate on more Spider-Man films and not films like this one. Utterly embarrassing! Madame Wen gets the lowest score possible with 1 star out of 10. Yes! It's that bad trust me."
brucecsnow,2,The Incredibly Stupids,"Total waste of time and I'm only half way through the movie. The only bigger was of time is writing a cogent review of the stinker. Somehow 4 girls have teamed up and only one of them's superpower is she can see 5 minutes into the future. Don't really understand the McGuffin of this movie other than it involves a spider. Slow, disjointed, outrageous, illogical girl power of a movie that I don't know how it ends but the bigger mystery is how it even got made. Its must have been one of the Marvel second wave of superhero movies that fail miserably. Suppose the Madame Web franchise is popular but I've never heard of it and don't expect to hear from it again."
jdt-55427,5,"Good performances, shame about the screenplay....","Had the direction and screenplay had been better, 'Madame Web' wouldn't have been a flop. None of the blame for that should be levelled at Johnson, Sweeney, O'Connor and Merced. They did the best with was what a hot-mess-of-a-script. The promise given to this project suffered because of it. Its central plotline needed some serious tinkering, so that a more engaging one might've been the end result.Such an improvement could have easily strengthened the performances the quartet of female lead actresses delivered.I can only hope Kevin Feige greenlights a MCU adaptation of this comic book character's adventures."

That's a huge hole in the script.Another problem is the expensive spiders in Peru. Their dialogues in the film don't convince, they don't move, they don't even sound natural.I don't consider it to be worse than Morbius. You can tell there was some kind of intention in this horrible script. The execution was a tragedy. The crude CGI of the AraÃ±as people was a good source of unintentional humor.I have the impression that Sony made this film with a not so high budget, betting on the possibility of becoming the source of several memes, Morbius style.Other than that, it was good fun."
JakeBrinkman,3,Exactly as bad as everyone says,"It has always been trendy to hate on non-MCU superhero movies. Since the release of Endgame, that trend has extended to nearly all superhero movies and shows. So I have lately been expecting every movie and show to be at least a little bit better than critics and audiences say. But in this case, Madame Web was exactly as bad as everyone says it is.I actually liked a lot of the major plot points and concepts, and several of the jokes were good. The 2 big problems were:1. All the minor details were unbelievably inconsistent and/or incorrect. I could barely follow the overarching story because I was constantly flabbergasted at how they could have possibly screwed up some minor detail so badly. The biggest one is that CPR is a huge recurring plot point for the movie, but apparently none of the actors were given even basic training on how to perform CPR (even in the scene where Web is teaching people how to do CPR lol).2. The acting was horrendous. O'Connor was the only one who tried to give a decent performance, but it's a little overacted. Everyone else is completely emotionless. Still, it is passable for everyone except Madame Web, Ben, and Ceiling Guy (the main villain who was so bad that I just watched the movie and already don't remember his actual name). Dakota Johnson didn't seem like a bad actress, but she put zero effort into her performance. It was the 2nd-worst wooden performance I've ever seen in a big budget production. Likewise, Adam Scott did decently well, but I've only ever seen him in comedies, so seeing him play serious Uncle Ben seemed like a major miscast. For Ceiling Guy, they re-recorded several lines without reshooting, so there are multiple scenes where his lip movements don't match his words, which is insane for even a low budget movie, let alone this $80M film. Plus he was a not-so-great actor given a terrible script to work with, which is a recipe for disaster.Morbius, the previous movie in this series that got a ton of hate from critics and audiences, was actually a decent film in my opinion. It was not incredible or even noteworthy, but it was still fun and I didn't regret watching it. I cannot say the same about Madame Web."
hypestyle,6,Madame Web Weaves Above Average Spider-Story,"""Madame Web"" is an action movie directed by SJ Clarkson.A woman-directed super-hero film is not unprecedented (Patty Jenkins directed the ""Wonder Woman"" feature films, and Cate Shortland directed ""Black Widow""). But this may be the first that is expected to introduce not one, but four femme Spider-heroes. As such, characters compete for attention and all come up short in some way. The use of flashbacks (and flash-forwards) as a narrative device also can confound many viewers. Still, the film has a just-barely-cohesive plot if you're already superhero sympathetic. But superhero fatigue-minded viewers may likely grow weary quickly.The main story involves New York City paramedic Cassandra Webb, who is hinted as having grown up in foster care after her scientist mother died in childbirth in Peru (a flashback scene begins the film, which also serves as a microwave origin for the villain Ezekiel, played by Tahar Rahim). Cassandra's mom was looking for a rare spider in the Amazon rainforest reputed to have healing properties distilled from its venom, but she was betrayed and murdered by Ezekiel.In the not-quite-present day (the film's main action takes place in 2003), Cassandra is aloof to a wide array of people, with only her paramedic partner Ben and his sister-in-law Mary as confidantes (the identities of Ben and Mary are just-barely concealed but will be obvious to most comics scholars). A near-fatal accident during a rescue seems to activate psychic visions in Cassandra, and in the midst of her bewilderment she crosses paths with three teen girls who are apparently being stalked for mysterious reasons by Ezekiel. (Ezekiel, who has Spider-Man-like abilities, also has psychic visions of the future, and is convinced that the three girls will be ""spider-heroes"" who will eventually bring about his demise-- thus, he sets out to preemptively kill them). Thus the main conflict in the film involves Cassandra's quest to keep the girls out of harm's way, despite her confusing psychic flashes.The script was credited to four writers (including the director) which arguably could be said to blame for the not-quite-fully engaging results. Some of the main shortcomings include the villain Ezekiel being something of a cipher (in the decades since killing Cassandra's mom, he apparently became some kind of big deal billionaire, though it's not particularly explained why). Also, the character development of the three teens suffers greatly. They're mainly painted in broad strokes: Sydney Sweeney's Julia is awkward and morose about her stepfamily in the wake of her mother's disappearance, Celeste O'Connor's very rude Mattie feels neglected by her jet-setting rich parents, while Isabele Merced's bookish Anya is apparently living on her own following her father's recent deportation. All three have coded abandonment issues, though the film doesn't particularly explore this, putting more emphasis on running for their life from Ezekiel. Some bright spots among the supporting cast are Adam Scott as Ben and Mike Epps as O'Neil (the latter of whom has an unfortunately smaller role to play in the narrative).The climax of the film takes place at a fireworks storage warehouse, which conveniently makes for a great place to stage an explosion-filled final act (it also provides the most ostentatious example of product placement in the film. Viewers of vintage superhero cinema may note that in 1978's ""Superman"" film, Clark Kent's mom casually retrieved a box of Cheerios out of a cupboard; this film's nod to a commercial sponsor is a bit more obvious. Some random plot inconsistencies are glaring as well.This writer will note that the film is part of the ""Sony Spider-Man Universe"", technically separate from the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe""-- due to the fine print of contracts currently held by Sony Pictures, the filmmakers are attempting to create a Spider-Man-centric sub-franchise with disparate characters, but they aren't allowed to interact with other characters from the Marvel world. Whether the ""Spider-Trio"" (or is it ""Spider-Quad"") is going to make for a commercially viable spinoff film is unknown. But this film is at least not-boring enough for an inoffensive afternoon or evening."
dogonlion,1,As bad as they say,"I opened my mind and thought people were going into this prepared to hate it because Dakota Johnson suffers from the curse of those who became more famous than they deserve. I was thinking, it can't be as bad as they say. Believe me when I say, it is. The script and screen play are the worse part of the movie. It feels like it was written by film school freshmen. So the actors didn't have much to work with to begin with. I believe Dakota Johnson would have been great for this if given a better material and the appropriate direction. I believe the production lost sight of the kind of movie they were doing and what the audience for this would expect. There's way too much talking and since the script is bad it's really annoying. One hour into the movie and really not much relating to the actual story of madame Web happens. I'm tired of the portrayal of teenagers in movies as annoying brats who are rude and never listen. I raised 2 teenagers who never behaved that way. I met all their friends from school and sports and never experienced the stuff I always see in movies and tv shows. But I digress, back to the movie. The going forth and back of Madame Web seeing the future was very annoying. Of all the movies in that category i cannot think of a worse one. Some people thought Catwoman with Halle Berry was bad. Well, compared to Madame Web, Catwoman should have won an Oscar. Now I even think the current rating of 3.9 here is way too high. I couldn't finish the movie. I quit at around 1 hour and 15 minutes. I'm glad I was able to doze off for 15 minutes during that time and got some much needed rest. Movie theaters are very comfy to sleep in while watching a horrible movie."
codyirwin-86855,8,Doesn't deserve the hate at all.,"I wasn't exactly sold on ""Madame Web"" at first. Superhero movies can feel like reruns of the same story, you know? But then I saw all of the horrible TikTok videos and reviews on it, and I wanted to see why it was hated so much. Well, I couldn't tell you why, because there is no actual reason. It's a pretty good movie, with a good plot.What I loved about ""Madame Web"" was its focus on a new character. We get to see her grapple with these incredible powers, and it's not just about learning to fight bad guys. The film asks questions about what it means to see the future, which is mind-blowing. It made me wonder, if you could see different futures, would you try to change things? Or would you just accept what's coming?Dakota Johnson is awesome as Madame Web. She brings so much strength and vulnerability to the role. The visuals are cool too, especially those trippy sequences that show what's going on in her head. The way they filmed them - all swirling colors and fractured images - made me feel like I was trapped in her mind.Look, ""Madame Web"" isn't perfect. The plot might not be the most original, and some things could be more developed. But it's a superhero movie with a fresh take, and it had me thinking long after the credits rolled. If you're looking for something different, with a cool lead character and trippy visuals, ""Madame Web"" is definitely worth a shot."
FlashCallahan,7,My Damn Web!!.....,"Cassandra Webb is a New York City paramedic who starts to show signs of clairvoyance in almost the same vein as Doctor Strange, but we are not in the official MCU, so its okay.Forced to confront revelations about her past, she must protect three young women from a mysterious adversary who wants them dead......'When you take on the responsibility, great powers will come'. I don't care how much you reword it, that's straight coming out of Spider-Man. Let's get the bad stuff out of the way first. The bad guy is really bad. In the fact that he is terribly acted, the ADR is all over the place, and his lines are terrible. Before he kills an agent (we never know what for), he literally says to her that he dreamt about being murdered. Doesn't sound too bad here, but seeing it in the context, and its laugh out loud funny.The other bad things are the plot holes (I'm not going into that, it's just a film, it's not going to affect anyone's life), and the product placement (well done Pepsi).The main problem is that, along with a lot of other superhero films being released from feb 2023 until Deadpool & Wolverine, is that this was set up to fail since the film was announced. Did anyone want an SSU? Did anyone want Sony to elaborate o something that they are clutching on to?The answer is, probably maybe.And I'm one of those people. I saw this at the first showing in my cinema in Leicester, England, and I'm happy to say that the screening was very busy, so some people still have love for this weird universe. Or, people like to go and see films, no matter what the content, and although I'm no die hard comic book fan, ill watch all of these films, until they cease to exist.The film is okay, Johnson can see things before they happen, but not as far as the bad guy (who killed her mother), and it has something to do with a spider, and men from the amazon who can climb up and down trees. And also, i almost forgot, there are three teens involved who kill the bad guy in a dream he had, so he's out to kill team. Does it make any sense? No!!! Does Spider-Man get referenced through out the film? Yes!!Is it fun? It is, but only in a way if you appreciate pure thrash at the cinema.Johnson is great, as are the other female leads, but the guy playing Ezekiel is terrible, and he destroys the film whenever he appears in it, which isn't often thank the lord.Other than that, it's a bright and breezy film, and any film that has a set piece to Brittany Spears' 'Toxic', earns an extra star from me.It's not a game changer, and it's nowhere as bas as the reviews make it to be, but one thing is for sure...............It's better than Morbius....."
briankoller,3,Dakota Johnson can't act,"There must be a leading theory that beautiful young women are good actresses because they look good on screen. That myth is busted by Dakota Johnson. Sure, she looks great, but she is about the worst actress I have ever endured. She is the lead of this film, and in most ever scence, so there is little hope for the movie to begin with. Throw in the usual ADHD style of filmmaking, where things are always happening and rarely follow Occum's Razor, and you might as well mute the video and simply gape at Dakota Johnson, because that is all this movie will provide you. I recommend the film only to those deaf viewers who get pleasure from close-ups of beautiful brunettes."
natron-23725,5,"Bad, but watchable","Yes it's bad, but not like crappy straight to home video and you end up turning it off after 10 minutes bad. Bad, but for some odd reason I wanted to see it through, not because I cared about the characters or the plot hooked me in the slightest, but because it was like watching a weird social experiment that I needed to see how it got pulled off.The most disappointing is being catfished by the trailers into thinking their is going to be intense Spider-Manesque action. There is none. The previews showing the spider-women is full regalia is a tease that never manifests in the movie. So the whole movie I'm waiting for a stellar climax to redeem it which never comes. Even Amazing Spider-Man 2 had enough action to cover its flaws. This movie has nothing cover its flaws. It's flaws are seemingly the point of the movie with now B-movie icon Dakota Johnson leading the charge."
Tradniam,5,Blame the script,"Step into theater with wife because of Johnson. Film is so popcorn. Don't mind the CGI & visual effects. Film is totally like late 80s or 90s, so predictable plot. Script wasn't well developed. No drama or anything to twist the ending. So no wonder when eventually Ezekiel easily finished.The only thing to help the simplicity was supposed to be on Johnson. Frankly what we saw was just same vibe of Cassie from one scene to another. Johnson should have left home her smiley face and get into character more. Johnson should have dig the character deeper.Sony had pushed too much for this spiderverse to be on. I believe by all the success of MCU, they should have cancelled this and do many corrections and improvisation for the sake of the company.Indeed it is one flop. Very sorry for how I have expected since its first trailer."
The_Bigstinker,1,MOST BORING MOVIE EVER,"When you take on the responsibility, great power will come. That's one of many examples of how bad the writing is. It felt like a movie by A. I., but they would be an insult to A. I. This movie was soooo boring! I almost fell asleep when watching this. It's laughable how bad this movie is. The one thing it had going for it was Ben Parker (Adam Scott). Scott really did the best with what he could. Don't even get me started on Ezekiel! He felt like such a minor inconvenience, which takes away from our main characters. He came off as such an inconvenience, but was a big threat to the girls. That just made them seem weaker than the movie was making them out to be. In my opinion there was just zero chemistry."
pridgeondesigngroup,1,Very little effort went into making this film.,"There are three writers credited on this film. Two of them wrote MÃ¶bius. The third, is a woman who literally has never written a thing in her life. Then they hired a woman to direct who has only worked in TV. This is her first big film directing. Then they decide to make Dakota Jonson the lead. Why? She has very limited range as an actress, and she is certainly not an action star. Her character has the ability to see the future and change it. Remember that great scene in Minority Report where Samantha Morton, being able to see into the future helps Tom Cruise escape pursuit? I expected this film to have similar moments. It has none. You can barely tell, amongst all the fireworks, when she has a vision of the future. The overall sense I got watching this was that I was watching a low budget television show. If you know all this going in maybe you wouldn't be so disappointed as I was."
wsbnrgvq,4,Just went with the first draft?,"Someone wrote the main plot and a few bullet point ideas on a napkin the night before filming began and they just went with that, it seems.There are plenty of reviews highlighting the bad points and I'll just highlight the main things for me.Ben Parker was way too old to not yet be with May, they're supposed to be an old couple who have been together forever by the time Peter gets his abilities but with this timeline they'd hardly have 10 years of marriage behind them.A truck smashes into an ambulance seemingly at a crossroads but as the camera pans out it was headed to a dead end at the edge of a dock so why was the truck going so fast 100 yards from a dead end?!Barely 2 minutes after they escape the subway it's already on the radio about police being attacked by them.After only 4 hours or so of being ""missing"" a truck driver has a copy of the Daily Bugle with the girls ""abduction"" as front page news... ON THE SAME DAY THE INCIDENT OCCURS! No paper is that fast to report, print and distribute in half a day.Madam Web steals a taxi cab and manages to drive around with no plates for a week or more, even leaving it at the airport whilst she has a small holiday with any repercussions.It certainly gave me some laughs, but for all the wrong reasons."
sagoth66,7,Honest Review: Not as bad as the trolls make out,"I've just come back from the cinema to see Madame Web in Imax 2D. I generally appreciate most films, some are better than others but they all have a script which is acted out and hopefully good enough for viewers to follow along. I read reviews beforehand and you can see the ratings which seem to make this one of the worst films ever however I always make up my own mind.I'm not one for pandering too much to the teens, as it can be somewhat annoying and there is some of that here which may be intentional. The characters are decent here and there is some good and relevant action which comes to a climax at the end. The CGI is pretty good although I still think there's work to be done on rapid movement (running, jumping) as it never seems natural. The story played out well and I followed it with interest for the full just short of 2 hours. I wasn't aware of the story beforehand so I can't say if it was obsessively true to the comics or not, but it was a decent story.There has been talk of it being a film to just set up a sequel (that now may not be made for some time) but it worked for me as a standalone. I enjoyed it and recommended it to my daughter. Others may be far more critical but every Marvel themed film can't be Infinity War.There used to be a forum posting facility on here for each film which was great however every film including the likes of The Green Mile had one post 'worst film ever' and 'half the audience walked out' which I have never seen in decades of seeing all types of films. This may be your 'worst film ever' or you may enjoy it but it's your opinion and you'll never know unless you give it a watch."
rharris-35,2,"Even for a Comicbook Movie, This is really bad","There are professionals in the world. Sometimes, they are described as doing a task for approximately 10,000 hours. I am very, very, sure, not one PROFESSIONAL touched this movie.Dakota Johnson's acting, remind me of a high school play lead, who only got the job, because she was the understudy. It is horrific acting.The structure of the movie is a complete mess. You just get thrown around with little context. I wasn't confused, I was always thinking, wait, what?I do not like writing bad reviews. There are just some thing's I was that are so great, I need to share in the hopes someone will take my advice and watch. Maybe something they normally wouldn't of watch, and take my review as a bit of helpful insurance is not horrible.Did I tell you HOW BAD the acting is? It's really, really bad."
victorsanchez-69993,6,The movie is not as bad as critics describe it.,"I just saw Madame Web today and despite it being a drama movie instead of superheroes, it's not bad. It is a normal movie to watch one day at home or family who wants to try something different.As a fan of Marvel, but especially of Spiderman, you forget that it is a superhero movie because of the plot of the movie. It is true that a man in a black suit dressed as Spiderman begins to chase 3 teenagers throughout the entire movie, but it is more of a plot of murderers than the whole thing.Personally, I didn't like changing the entire plot and removing Spider-Man from the movie, because the plot required having someone powerful to be able to fight Ezequiel Sims. The powers aspect was too distant, and it is impossible for me to believe that someone with super strength, spider sense, regeneration, etc. Was defeated by a normal person who could only see the future.Dakotan Johnson said in an interview that the script was completely changed after they signed the contract for the film, which is seen to be true due to the constant cuts in the film, the forced scenes without deep dialogues, the fillers of the girls for wanting to be teenagers and an Ezekiel plot for not wanting to make a plan to get revenge in the future.One of the things that bothered me was changing Spider-Man's iconic phrase, but not only that, it was removing him from the map completely. I understand that Sony wants to give importance to secondary characters in the universe, but in reality we fans only want to see Spiderman and Spiderman Variants, nothing more. But ask them about all the projects that have the name Spiderman that are well received. So the question is, why make a movie fail by removing the star producer? WE WON'T KNOW."
dhanjusanveer,1,If the Writers Guild Strike were summed up as a movie...,"One of the most lazy scripts I have ever witnessed. It's like the screenplay never made it past the first draft. And the acting suffers because of it.If this was the case for ChatGPT writing a movie script, it failed horribly and proves writers are needed.But, strategic move on Marvels part. I think this release intended to keep the 'Marvel' brand in the limelight while they waited out the writers strike. I'm the meantime they could spend a small budget on an independent studio and not care about the reception because it's not a direct injection into the Marvel universe.Hopefully, that time and effort was spent working on the revival of the Canon Marvel cinematic universe."
HuskerCubs72,5,"Great concept, poor execution","I have always been a fan of Spider Man and Madame Web was a part of his orbit. When they decided to do this movie I was hoping for a lot more but unfortunately they SPUN this one wrong.I doubt now that we will continue with this web unfortunately, maybe they should have made it more of a TV series instead of a feature movie.So much potential ruined with a bad script, a horribly written villain and generally terrible direction for the storyline.I am not certain what could have saved it, maybe one or two less girls for her to protect and guide to start maybe going with all three was a bit of an overreach considering how comic movies have been failing lately.It's really too bad though."
alatlantic,1,What in the heck,"I have trouble even finding the words to describe this movie. I thought it was going to be about a clairvoyant woman from the tagline, and it sounded interesting enough.Wow was that wrong. It apparently has something to do with spiders, and tribal people, and webs, and superheroes? I don't even know anymore. Whoever wrote this piece of trash had no clear vision of what they were even making. I'm beyond confused at who would even greenlight such a story.Sometimes actors can carry a bad story, but not the case here. Other than Scott, they're all pretty bad too.I'm going to be honest, I couldn't even keep my eyes on this thing the entire time. And I suggest you not either."
codeyearfour-854-702360,2,Who authorized this movie,"This is one of the absolute worst movies I have ever endured. I finished it just to make sure I wasn't going crazy. Jokes are super cheesy and not meant for any relevant human being that lives or ever lived. I never leave reviews. The fact that people paid to watch this and people were paid to act this bad is beyond flabbergasting. Who allowed this movie to be produced and directed has committed acts of crimes against the human brain. As much as I want to support all of the actors, it was so cringy to watch bad jokes and stereotypical attitudes from certain characters. They had one specific girl acting rude and sassy while everyone was calm and collective."
justinwest-14208,1,Literally one of the worst movies ever made,"To be fair though, I don't watch many bad movies but this one seemed like one that at least had content to make fun of instead of a long drawn out movie.I'll start off with the good (I'm stretching a lot with what I consider ""good""). For starter, like I said before, at the very least it had content that I could laugh at how bad it was. The only reason I didn't shut it off immediately was how laughable the movie was.The only actual thing I can think of that wasn't utter garbage was the use of Uncle Ben as a character and the casting of Adam Scott. Something they should've utilized a lot more but were probably worried about their contract with Disney. The concept of her powers aren't horrible but that was taken from the sane writers of the comic books. There was a jump scare that partly made me jump, but then again, why do we need a jump scare in a spiderman movie?Acting/casting: 1/10
The villain in the movie is so horribly casted and acted, it is beyond atrocious. His voice is so campy, I literally could not tell if he was trying. But most of the main characters are not necessarily bad actors but are directed and written in a way that made me think these actors were bad at acting(Dakota Johnson & Sydney Sweeney). I don't know the other two girls but they didn't do very good. Adam Scott was the only one that was tolerable, probably from being the only experienced actor.One part that disturbed me and that goes to show how out of touch with reality the writers of this show are was the point in the movie where 3 OBVIOUS UNDERAGE GIRLS started indecently DANCING above 6 or 7 COLLEGE BOYS on a TABLE. It was not only unbelievably unrealistic but also just disturbing. Keep in mind, these were girls who AUDIBLY stated they were still in high school and heavily implied to be quite young. Who in their right mind would ever allow that scene to go in the movie??Characters: 0/10
The main character is downright unlikable, the three spider-woman are written all as annoying little brats, and the villain is the most unrespectable character in Marvel history, not for what he was going to do but just because he is incredibly idiotic. He's more unrespectable than Thanos, who just straight up murders 50% of planets populations.Dialogue: 0/10Plot: 0/10WIP."
revencr,3,bellow my expectations.,"Great cast, bad scripts.The audience feels sleepy throughout the film. The set up is quite long, with the ending not being that impressive.Some characters are cliche, want to appear rebellious but cannot take responsibility for their actions.The cinematography in the early scenes looks strange. The camera shakes, zooms in and zooms out, kind of like an Indian film.Uninteresting soundtrack choices, and mediocre cgi graphics.With a 80 million USD budget, it could have been better than this, it feels like it was made just to fill a void and maintain the existence of Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios."
darkreignn,7,"I walked in expecting to hate it, and ended up liking it","With a current 13% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 3.8 out of 10 on IMDb, I walked into the theatre to watch ""Madame Web"" fully expecting a cinematic failure on every level. And in fact, I walked into the theatre stone cold sober, because I wanted to be coherent and present as I watched this so-called train wreck unfold. But then the movie started. And I'm going to be so honest with you - I don't think this film is as bad as the critics say.When you walk into a movie titled ""Madame Web,"" there's a certain level of quality that you should expect; i.e., you should probably expect the movie to be god awful. And that's exactly what I was expecting. And maybe my rock bottom expectations actually made me enjoy the movie more than I thought I would, because not only didn't I think that the movie was awful, but I also thought that it was a pretty high quality film based solely on entertainment value. Because I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained.After a shaky opening scene that did have me regretting every life decision that I've ever made that lead up to the moment I bought a ticket for this movie, I started to notice something curious: ""Madame Web"" actually had some competence behind the camera. The kinetic editing and camerawork caught my attention immediately, as it wasn't something I was expecting from a movie rated this poorly. And so, I continued to watch with slightly higher expectations at this point; and then Dakota Johnson appeared on screen - and she was actually giving a good performance! At this point I was shocked; reviews criticized Dakota's acting, as well as the script, but I just wasn't getting that overtly horrible feeling that others seemed to be. And so I continued watching - and I started to have... I started to have... fun.Less a superhero film and more of ""Final Destination"" lite, ""Madame Web"" turns into a chaotic adventure film of sorts, following four women who try to avoid death at every turn, complete with premonitions of impending doom and elaborate getaways. I started to really enjoy the loop of the film so to speak, where Dakota would have her visions of a potential future death and then get to work on changing said future - it's nothing innovative, but I haven't seen something like this done since the last ""Final Destination"" movie, and as a big fan of those films, I was having fun with what ""Madame Web"" was doing. And I was also having fun with its characters.The trio of Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor had a lot of fun chemistry together, and not to mention, are eye candy to the extreme, and so I enjoyed watching them play off each other. Sure, they aren't believable in the slightest as high school students, but I really didn't care because of how much I was enjoying watching them on screen (and yes, their beauty may have something to do with that). But besides that, I did have fun with their interactions with each other and with Dakota; once again, critics mentioned how horrendous they thought these three actresses were and, once again, I just failed to see that. (I also really enjoyed a sequence with all of them and a certain Britney Spears song playing - it was so much fun!).And I'd be amiss if I didn't mention, once again, the competency behind the camera, because I legitimately really enjoyed the direction and editing here. I found it to be surprisingly kinetic, with a really great sense of urgency and energy. I expected this movie to look and feel like a direct to DVD movie, but it really didn't.Listen, I fully thought I would hate this movie, but I didn't. I liked it. This isn't a great film, this isn't a cinematic classic, and it isn't even high cinema, but it is a good time at the movies. And that's all it needed to be."
theprestonator-37584,4,Uhh...,"Wow! Plain awful. I could see where they were trying to go with it but they failed at all costs. Dakota Johnson and Isabela Merced are the only redeemable qualities of this film. They were good at acting for what they were given. But mylanta this was dog crap. Was this the worst movie I've ever seen? No, but in all honesty I couldn't name you the worst movie I've ever seen. The story was all over the place. The camera work gave me a headache. There were some really weird angles that makes no sense. The CGI was awful and some of the lips did not even match with what the guy was saying. Sony needs to stop making these films. It was worse than I expected."
johncharrison-12736,10,"They should change the name of the Academy Award from ""Oscar"" to ""Webby.""","There is a new gold standard in filmmaking, and it is Madame Web. The makers of Madame Web put on an absolute clinic with the creation of this masterpiece that the likes of Tarantino, Scorsese, Spielberg and Wiseau and Breen should study and attempt to emulate. USC film school should have an entire class - nay, SEMESTER dedicated to the study and analysis of this next evolutionary step in the art of filmmaking. If Kubrick and Hitchcock were alive, they would weep at their wasted years and failures upon viewing this masterclass and peak of cinematic culture.As a viewer, Madame Web was not a movie, but an experience. Just watching this grand treasure on the silver screen was the closest that most of us will ever be to being in the presence of true greatness and genius. Madame Web should be shown in the Louvre at all times. Temples should be erected where those of us so touched, so moved by this experience can go to pay our respects, or perhaps dedicate our lives to a humble existence of servitude and deep reflection on the message, lessons, and teachings shared by director S. J. Clarkson in this new form of enlightenment.I am weeping at the beauty of what Sony Pictures has created and shared with all of us, wealthy and poor, young and old alike. My life will never be the same."
cruise01,6,Origin superhero story thats grounded with decent action.,"3 out of 5 stars.Madame Web is a fair superhero film which is better to not have high expectations or expecting a big superhero film with epic action. If you can expect more of a thriller which feels like that what this film is trying to be.Plot was okay. Acts like an origin story for Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson). She gets her abilities after nearly dying from a fall. After she can see glimpse of the future and tries to save others from getting killed. She sees three young girls being targeted by Eziekel who is like the bad guy verson of spider man without the webs. His reasoning is those three girls become spider woman in the future and they stop him from being powerful.The cast ensemble did okay. Dakota Johnson. Sydney Sweeney. Isabela Merced. And Celeste O'Connor all did great with there roles.The script has some cheesy dialogue. Or could have been better written. The action sequences are okay. S. J. Clarkson direction on handling the action scenes are decent. Clearly had trouble trying to keep a coherent action scene put together. It could have been a whole lot worse.Will say do not expect a spider man film quality. Expect more of a thriller of Dakota trying to help three girls escape from a strong skilled villain. Also dont expect to see the spider-woman on screen. Which could have been cool to see more of. You only get brief moment of all three girls in a spidey costume which was a glimpse of the future that we may never see again.Overall, the film could have been worse. Acting was okay. The script was iffy. The action was uninspired and passable."
zee-67077,1,This sucks,"Madam Web swings into action, but instead of weaving a compelling superhero tale, it spins a web of confusion. The feminist angle feels more like an afterthought, leaving viewers hanging. The plot, much like a spider's web after rain, is sticky, messy, and hard to navigate. In trying to break new ground, the movie ends up entangled in its own ambitions, leaving audiences wondering if they've stumbled into a web of disappointment rather than a heroic adventure.The characters, unfortunately, lack the depth one would hope for in a superhero flick. It's as if they got caught in the web of rushed character development, leaving them thinly sketched and devoid of the charisma needed to captivate audiences. Even the visual effects can't save this tangled mess, as they often feel like an afterthought rather than a seamless part of the storytelling.In the end, Madam Web swings for the fences but misses, creating a movie experience that leaves you untangling the threads of disappointment. Perhaps next time, they should focus on spinning a more cohesive narrative rather than getting caught in the intricate but ultimately confusing web they've created."
killsthetitam,1,Go on YouTube and wait for someone to upload it,"Save your money and wait for someone to stream it online for free. I promise you'll enjoy spending your money on a different movie.The return of actresses that I've grown to love over the years is a wonderful addition, however, that's only because I associate seeing them with greatness. Unfortunately, the writers that Sony hires are terrible. Sony is only concerned at making things look cool and for this film that's funny because not many things looked cool.. Without spoiling the movie, I can say is this movie has the backbone of a final destination film that should've never been made. This movie will make you scratch your head. If you love the Spider-Man comics and will make you scratch your head. If you love the MCU I would just avoid this and wait for it to be free somewhere that you can stream it or pirate it."
ryanpersaud-59415,1,"Unlike Morbius, this movie is so bad it's fun to watch. A hilarious failure.","I cannot believe how bad this movie is. Madame Web might be the most incompetently made major ""blockbuster"" studio film released in this decade so far. It's an honest-to-God so bad it's good movie in the making that I'm ecstatic exists, because it's so funny and totally worth seeing in theatres if cringe humour is your thing. I'm serious.There is not a single element from this film that's done right. Madame Web, for those who don't know, is an ally of Spider-man who can see into the future and therefore, helps him with crime fighting. She's supposed to be a mutant, so the bizarre origin story as presented in this movie isn't even comic accurate. How she gets her powers and where they come from is barely explained, yet factors heavily into the story as a whole.Really, a lot in this movie is just NEVER explained. It's almost as if they made a film hoping for a sequel, but also not wanting a sequel? Because on and behind the screen, it's apparent no one REALLY cared about this movie. Every single performance is absolutely terrible. Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney might as well have read these lines on the toilet and had a robot version of them on screen. The villain, played by Tahir Rahim, is...legitmately Tommy Wiseau levels of bad here.Not only does he have no screen presence and not only is his motivation absolutely hilarious (he essentially wants to kill three random women he sees in a reccuring vision, and never stops and thinks...could my actions be leading to this outcome?). But his dialog all sounds ADR and the accent he puts on is a mishmash of every ""foreign"" accent you've ever heard, and he's as wooden as a tree.The film is also really poorly shot and edited even worse. It's not just that it looks flat and boring, but it's actively confusing what's going on in many of the action and ""premonition"" scenes (often over done with effects to hide that) and what certain shots and edits are attempting to convey to the audience. Basic film making techniques are fudged here.There are so many little things in this movie, from the costumes to the casting to the sound design/engineering/mixing to the script, that just feel OFF. The dialog is atrocious for most it, often petering out with no point to it (the final line of the movie had my brother and I laughing uncontrollably because of how meaningless it was). The movie sounds terrible, with the music often too low but random sound effects too high. The three girls we follow are supposed to be teenagers, but look closer to Dakota Johnson's age, and even the clothes they wear feel oddly inappropriate.I haven't even really gotten to the plot, which is essentially the Terminator except worse in every regard. There are probably a bunch of plot holes and contrivances I haven't even thought of yet. The plot actually feels like a fever dream and written by kids. I'm not exaggerating.I could go on and on, but you get the point. If you love cringe inducing bad movies that inadvertently teach you about what makes good films good, look no further. This really represents the bottom of the barrel for superhero films this decade. Incredible."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,4,Please let him out of the ADR booth!,"Yet another hopeless entry in the Cinematic Universe entirely built around characters that are important to Spider-Man, even though they can't feature him and some of them don't work independently of him at all.There are some excellent feminist themes here, most of which are woefully under explored. These include the way that women have to stick together in a world where certain ego-driven men are out to hurt them, while the cops refuse to help. The way they are treated even by supposed loved ones. It has entirely too many characters; they should probably have stuck with just Cassandra and Julia, and not include Anya and Maddie. Other than the last one, and a scene stealing Emma Roberts, none of the actors seem 100% comfortable with the characters they're playing. It doesn't appear to me that it's a matter of talent on the part of the performers - rather, it's the material they were given.The special effects are severely underwhelming. Action in this movie is just not that engaging. The script has too many different ideas that don't gel together. There is absolutely no way that The Terminator by way of Final Destination should be this boring. It reeks of studio notes. The director did substantially better work on the amazing Jessica Jones and the great The Defenders, so it's not that she doesn't know what she's doing. There are some neat ideas such as the way on multiple occasions we see the protagonist through webs, sometimes actual arachnid ones, frequently it is broken glass that ends up looking like it. 4/10."
valmont1702,5,Cassandra Webb's emotional and psychological journey ; not your typical superhero movie,"Aside from the final scene and a few moments here and there (which by the way, are very efficient, catchy, and baddass ; and make you want to have more of this ""flavor""), this movie doesn't use much of the usual ingredients you find in superhero or action/adventure movies... It mainly revolves around the psychological and human journey, with an emotional growth for Cassandra & her three protégés (Julia being the most layered, sensible, and invested of the three ; Celeste being the rebel and loud one, while Anya is the smart cookie of the trio)...
The strenght of the movie definitely is the evolving bond between these four women, which obviously peaks and pays off nicely during the grand finale !What I have appreciated in this movie is how Cassandra progressively understands what's going on, her story, and how it all finds its source in the moment when she was born... And it's cool to see her embrace her powers more and more, step by step ; she grows as a person and as a superhero at the same time, because both are linked and reciprocally improve one another...The various déjà vus and callbacks are fairly interesting to look at, and the thing is that there are several scenes (that I liked quite a bit) that focus a lot on ""how it feels"" in this suspended moment... And when it pays off, I think it's always nicely rewarding !But yeah, the main problem of the film is that in different moments it feels underwhelming in comparison with the high majority or superhero movies... It is kind of uneven, the pace is a little on and off ; but at the same time the story keeps moving forward for most of the movie.Most of the actors do a good job ; Dakota Johnson (Cassandra Webb) carries the movie pretty efficiently, Sydney Sweeney (Julia Cornwall) and Adam Scott (Ben Parker) were convincing and relatable in their roles, and Tahar Rahim (Ezekiel Sims) as well as Emma Roberts (Mary Parker) both brought a certain charisma to their part.A nice touch is the reconstitution of the year 2003 (it's often way more complicated to re-create an era that takes place 20 years ago than it is to create an era that takes place 2 centuries ago ; simply because it's closer to us, we have a certain memory of it, but in fact it requires to work in a big quantity of small details in order to make it right) ; the soundtrack pays homage to multiple songs from 2003.I enjoyed the story arc of the main ""good guys"", the few Spider-Man Easter eggs were quite tasty and cool to witness, and I personally really loved the grand finale because it's explosive and intense (visually and emotionally as well) !In the end, this movie is more like a prequel to the bigger Spiderverse than anything else ; therefore you can be curious to see Madame Webb become like an oracle to Peter Parker, and the trio of Spider-Girls being like Spider-Aunts to him !The problem is that this movie doesn't exactly kill it at the box office or in the ratings !I could have gone for a 6 but I personally give it between 5 and 6 out of 10 (I went for a 5 simply because it felt closer to the movies to which I already gave a 5). But I liked it, I found it fine. I think for the most part it did fairly well what it had to do ; there just wasn't that much meat on that bone in order to consider it a very good or great one, in my humble opinion. For example (and I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on that) I really would have liked to see more of the trio of Spider-Girls in action in their suits ! Like I said, it is more like a prequel ; in many ways."
yaakovher,3,"Yeah, no... it's bad. It's really really bad","Poor CGI, poor directing, poor writing, poor acting, so many holes in the plot, so many weird flashbacks and deja vu's.The Sydney Sweeney character is sooo caricature it's pure cringe.Dakota is really trying her best, but it doesn't always work.And the saddest thing is that this movie is actually pretty smart, all about girl power and full of potential.I'm totally regretting watching it. It was such a waste of time, and watching it in IMAX was really bad, since the volume is really not balanced.I did like though the Adam Scott character and the style of Dakota'/ character.What a shame... don't bother watching it."
imranyunis,7,Don't understand all the hate,"This is a good, lite action movie. Good to watch with the family. I don't understand the 3.9 review average, I gave it a shot in spite of that rating and it was a good 'popcorn and coke' movie. Something entraining to put on Friday night with some snacks. Maybe if you're a Spider-Man purist this won't appeal to you.Dakota Fanning does a pretty good acting job and her cast of young teenage co-stars while annoying at times played the role of annoying teenage girls very well. I'm also a fan of the guy who played the bad spider man. One thing I didn't like is they didn't develop his character well."
pathudon,1,What the... Web,"Try to spot all the Pepsi ads! This movie was just so ridiculous, there is every cliche possible, about superpowers, family, orphans and everything else. Its so stupid. They even used the effect from Doctor Strange and the costume from spider man. This movie has to be the worst one coming from Marvel. Everything is so far fetched. The swearing was completely useless. I was looking back and thinking about which scenes should be cut and every single one deserves it. There is way too much useless information and as I felt like the move might just be one you need to rewatch to understand, I realized its not a movie to have a realization, its just for the younger audience. Maybe some people will find it enjoyable, but I wasn't part of those people."
Steve-from-Texas,8,IGNORE THE CRITICS!,"I loved the movie. It was fast paced. It has action, suspense and kept me on the edge of my seat. I never thought Dakota Johnson could pull off a movie like this one, but she was fantastic. She was believable and likeable.The movie has been panned by critics and audiences alike and I just don't understand why. It's really a shame that the movie didn't fare better at the box office. I want to see the rest of the story, and because of the financials, there probably won't be a sequel. Hopefully they'll finish the story anyway.Do yourself a favor... ignore the critics and watch it for yourself. I bet you'll enjoy it too."
info-90701,6,"I thought it would be so much worse from the complaints, but . . .","This film really wasn't as bad as the reviews have led us to believe. I think the real problem is that it is terribly miscast with Dakota Johnson. She is too namely-pamby for this role. It needed a much higher energy actor, and she is so one note that just her personality and delivery made it seem much dryer and slower than the writing actually provided. That's a shame that they didn't cast it better. There are so many truly strong young women who could have gotten an entirely different delivery from this role. This child has zero charisma.Chloë Grace Moretz, or Bella Thorne would have been so much stronger, or a list of 30 other young women.The script was not actually that bad, and in the hands of a better casting agent and perhaps director, this would have been a very different film."
huntdog46,5,Don't listen to the haters,"Was it the best comic movie? No. Was it the worst? No. Overall it was entertaining enough even with the ending. The writing isn't there and there are some loop holes throughout it, but if you just want to watch a comic movie that has a bunch of Easter eggs (as many as Sony could get away with) and have some popcorn then watch the movie.Again, I am not saying it's a great movie but all the 1 star reviews are bogus. I would hate to see what they rate movies that ""go straight to vhs"" back in the day. Give it a watch and if you don't like it, then you don't. That's the beauty of film. It's not always for everyone."
apelqvistante,1,Pure garbage.,"Dissecting the Disappointment of Madame Web: A Blatant Failure in Superhero FilmmakingAs a self-proclaimed superhero movie aficionado, I had eagerly anticipated the release of Madame Web with bated breath. However, my excitement was quickly shattered as I sat through what can only be described as a colossal disappointment, leaving me yearning for the wasted hours back. Regrettably, Madame Web proves to be an exemplification of everything that can go wrong in the superhero genre.First and foremost, the film suffers from an abysmally weak and poorly crafted narrative. It fails to establish a coherent and engaging storyline, leaving viewers perplexed and detached from the characters' plights. The lackluster script seems more like a feeble attempt to join random dots rather than a thought-through plot, further exacerbating the shallowness of the overall film.One of the most glaring issues in Madame Web lies in its squandered potential for character development. With a fascinating protagonist boasting a unique and intriguing backstory, one would expect depth and complexity. Unfortunately, the filmmakers neglected to explore the depths of the titular character, leaving her largely two-dimensional and devoid of the emotional resonance required for a compelling superhero tale.Moreover, the film's pacing is reminiscent of a slumber-inducing snail. Instead of leveraging action sequences and injecting adrenaline into the story, Madame Web becomes an exercise in patience. The movie drags on with a plodding tempo, causing disinterest and ultimately disengagement from the audience.On the technical front, the special effects are embarrassingly underwhelming. In today's age of advanced CGI and stunning visuals, Madame Web falls egregiously short. The lack of attention to detail is apparent, and the visual effects seem outdated and unimpressive, detracting from any potential for visual spectacle that could have captivated viewers.In addition, the film suffers from incompetent direction and subpar acting performances. The cast appears disengaged and uninspired, failing to evoke any genuine emotion or connection. The characters' dialogue often feels forced and devoid of authenticity, amplifying the overall artificiality of the movie.To add insult to injury, the film's marketing campaign created unrealistic expectations that Madame Web would deliver an enthralling and immersive superhero experience. Sadly, it fails to live up to even the most forgiving of expectations, leaving audiences disheartened and questioning the mainstream superhero genre's diminishing creativity.In conclusion, Madame Web undoubtedly falls into the category of abstaining superhero movies to be avoided. Its abysmal narrative, shallow character development, sluggish pacing, subpar visual effects, and lackluster performances combine to create an overall underwhelming film experience. For devoted superhero enthusiasts and casual viewers alike, I strongly advise staying away from this cinematic travesty and investing your time more wisely elsewhere."
Terrorformer,2,2 stars for laughs,"It's funny how a superhero movie comes along and everyone piles on it (including the usual fans of the MCU and DCU)This movie IS terrible but it's honestly no worse than anything Disney marvel has put out in the past 3 years. But I guess people openly hate this because it's not connected to their precious MCU or anything else for that matter?I dunno but yea this is a really stupid movie. But it is actually very funny too. In an unintentional way. I was genuinely laughing throughout this entire movie. The dialogue, acting and just general actions of the characters was hilarious.Would i recommend paying money to watch it? Nope ::wink wink::"
Brin2070,1,"Oh, boy...","As an avid fan of comic book movies, I walked into Madame Web with high hopes, even after hearing some less-than-stellar reviews. Unfortunately, my optimism was quickly dashed as I realized that this film truly lived up to its negative buzz. It's not just bad-it's catastrophically so.Dakota Johnson, bless her heart, seemed to be operating on a completely different wavelength from the rest of the cast. Despite her valiant efforts, she couldn't salvage a script that was so woefully inadequate that it could sink even the most talented of actors. Adam Scott, who usually delivers solid performances, was sadly underutilized, leaving me wondering why they bothered casting him in the first place.The story, such as it was, felt like it was just getting started when the credits began to roll. It's as if the filmmakers forgot to include the actual plot and opted instead for a haphazard collection of scenes loosely strung together.My curiosity led me to investigate the writing team, and what I found was alarming. It took four people to pen this disaster, two of whom were responsible for other cinematic disasters like Morbius, Dracula Untold, and Gods of Egypt. Combine that with a director who seemed to have lost their way, and it's no wonder this movie ended up being such a trainwreck.There were moments where I found myself chuckling at the unintentional humor stemming from the cringe-worthy dialogue. It's as if the writers had never heard a real conversation in their lives.Even the usually reliable Sydney Sweeney couldn't escape unscathed from this mess. It's a shame to see such talent wasted on a project like this.And let's not even get started on the special effects, which looked like they were lifted from a mid-2000s video game.In conclusion, Madame Web is a comic book movie that fails on nearly every level. With a disjointed plot, uninspired performances, and laughable special effects, it's a film that should be avoided at all costs. Here's hoping that the next outing for this iconic character fares far better in the hands of more capable filmmakers."
spite-37183,1,"Pretty sure this wasn't meant as a comedy, but it was","From the astonishingly poor writing to silly CGI, this thing had me cracking up about 5 minutes in. Hard to tell if the actors were bad, or were also trying desperately not to laugh. This movie seems like Disney cut and pasted bits of plot from previous (successful) movies and laid them over a social justice and ""girl power"" message. The whole movie felt like sitting at a show with a magician who had lost her magic desperately trying to find the card that was picked. As the minutes tick by, you realize it's not a joke and then it becomes uncomfortable. All the more so considering the epic entertainment Marvel once provided theater-goers."
TommyStorm,1,Worst film in decades,"After watching this abomination, I felt inclined to write my first review ever on this platform. It was rejected. Probably because I used much profanity due to being so angry. You know, the anger you feel when realising a studio decided spending so many millions of dollars on such absolute garbage was a good idea.I'm positive the writers made sure to be paid upfront, then spent an hour with ChatGPT before high-fiving each other for a well executed scam, and getting cocktails down the street.The money would have been better spent in a furnace, keeping a family warm over winter.Consider this the best tip you'll get this year:
Do. Not. Watch. It."
ccopeland-76265,6,"Poorly written, entertaining, Madame Webb","Sorry but entertaining attempt by Sony to do a marvel movie, but oh so many plot holes!I found myself enjoying it despite huge missing pieces, unresolved stories and completely contrived outcomes. But, oddly enough with this amalgam of flaws, I found the film entertaining.Dakota Johnson does what she can as well as the three main actresses with what they're given.As to the villain, Eziquiel, he does a terrible job of acting, and actually his work as a rip off Spider-Man is perhaps the worst part of this movie along with the terrible writing.The three kids being protected that are going to be future superheroes are caricatures, but you care what happens to them.Clearly they had hoped that this would be the beginning of perhaps at least a sequel but I don't think that would include Madame Webb but more perhaps the three budding superheroes."
pajorpawel,1,It is so bad that even Loki and whole of TVA stayed away from this universe...,Absolute garbage. Someone should ban the director from touching any future comic book story.Not sure how it is possible to waste nearly 80 million bucks on a movie but the director managed to do it perfectly and they even made some profit... how is that even possible I have bo ideaIt is an insult to a movie making industry I think I enjoyed mentos comercials more than this.I wish I could unsee this but now it is too late and I have to live with this like with a reflux after really bad mealOn the bright side the female cast was beautiful and we get to learn how to do the cpr properlyShockingly bad!
yonatannir-78033,8,a very fun movie,"I seriously don't understand the hate for this movie. It was pretty fun and entertaining.After reading other reviewes of the more lower ratings, I expected an inchoerent plot with no part of the movie really connected to the other parts, but that wasn't the case at all. It's not like this movie is perfect or top super hero movie quality like Guardians of the Galaxy or something like that, and there was a part where i was thinking something like ""why would the hero do what they just did?"", but it was definitely something worth watching at least once. I'm guessing it might be more of a hate towards the actress than the movie?Why do people hate it so much???"
kerry-244,7,Not near as bad as many say,"I'm not sure why so many say it was so bad. There were things that could have been done better but it's a hick of a lot better than for example The Marvels. I wish there was only one ""future spider woman"" she was trying to save. I wish the pulling up next to a crow bar so she could take the license plate of the tax was presented as part of her powers rather than chance. I wish the fireworks factory was just a machine shop and the fireworks didn't somehow break down walls in a person sized opening just in time. A little too much coincidence and stretched reality, but at least no magically turning into a princess and dancing with a prince in a ballroom on a musical planet (Marvels)."
JanNiggers,3,Badly edit and too long.,"This movie had some potential to be an entertaining flick.... but unfortunately all hopes for It vaporizes very quickly.Editing in this movie feels very amateur-ish and sometimes feels like a complete joke.Pacing Is all over the place, there are sequences that are too fast or too quick and few times feels just awful.Writing is just awful. There are scenes where stuff happens and nothing feels emotional (talking about emotions , not just crying).Characters... what characters? There are people with names and that's about IT. We barely know anything about anyone in this movie. Bad guy is bad, girls are girls , paramedic is paramedic....The ""see future"" gimmick is very poorly presented. It's not very consistent when the WHOLE MOVIE is about It.Was this movie even entertaining? No. I haven't chuckled/laughed at any jokes this movie provided... although I did laugh at the technical aspects of this movie, especially the ""advanced"" technology that was in 2003.I'm giving IT 3/10, It's on the same level as Morbius or Marvels."

Morbing time took up all sony is worth when it comes to movies.Obviously trying to just ensure they keep the rights to parts of the spiderman franchise they paid for to keep Kraven the hunter a thing. I'd say cash grab, but this won't make anything then it's worth and Dakota shows as much emotion then a rock. But she was likely forced to do it. Considering the interviews."

The main characters are not likeable no matter how much I tried I got that cringe feeling.The villain looked like a heroine addict... I wish there was booth were I can demand my money back we should just rally infront of the cinema and demand our money back this is just such a disgrace."
Alphadogathome,1,Entangled in a Web of Disappointment,"Madame Web swings into theaters with all the grace of a toddler learning to walk. From its convoluted plot to its uninspired visuals, this film is a frustrating misfire that fails to live up to even the most modest expectations. The narrative is an incoherent mess, jumping between timelines and introducing characters with little to no explanation. The central villain's motivations are muddled, and the supposed ""twist"" ending lands with a thud. By the time the credits roll, you'll be left wondering what you just witnessed more than anything else.Bland Performances, Clumsy Spectacle: The talented cast struggles to elevate the weak material. The dialogue is clunky and expository, delivering forced exposition and lacking any genuine emotional connection. The action sequences are equally forgettable, relying on generic CGI and uninspired choreography.It's particularly disappointing considering the potential Madame Web held as a character. Her unique abilities and connection to the spider-verse could have made for a compelling story. Unfortunately, the film squanders this potential, leaving audiences with a hollow experience.Save your money and your time. There are far better ways to spend your movie-going experience."
ghuffdc,1,Clearly no EMS advisor for this film.,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen since Howard the Duck. It was all over the place, the pacing was weird, the character development was bizarre, and the details were awful.

Why were the three girls in costume and why did they have powers in his nightmare, but not really, just kidding.So many incongruities and forced motivations. Half-hearted solo CPR in the street while three medics stretcher one dude to an ambulance? Come on.Campfire left burning in the woods? No problem, and how did they start the fire to begin with? She ""teaches"" them CPR? Barely, so cringe. ""You're a great teacher"" eye-roll.Paramedic's wife is in labor, time to go into panic mode. What??Medic bag has flares and smoke grenades? Of course it would. How did the bad guy find them at the warehouse?I swear the villain was voice-dubbed. It was super annoying to watch his lips move, but the words didn't match.So, so dumb. Don't waste your hard earned dollars."

supermario1,6,Not even close to as bad as they say,"All I heard was how bad this is, and worst movie ever, and this will hurt Dakota Johnson's career, and sad that Sydney Sweeney had to be in this, etc, etc. I was watching it and waiting for it to get really bad and unwatchable, but that never happened. Was it perfect? No. Was it Spider-Man, Capt America or Ironman? No. Why does everyone expect the next movie to be better than the rest? Madame Web was more story than action and when there was action it was decent. However, they should have done something different for the final showdown. I don't think this is a spoiler, but the warehouse and endless fireworks...? What was that? The end with the three girls in Spider-like costumes was a little cheesy and looked more like a network wanna-be superhero show and could have been done a little grittier/darker.This is a very watchable superhero flick that is far better than the three-point-something stars that it has while I write this. Hopefully being on Netflix's will boost it up into the 5 to 6ish range."

sjo-15,8,Surprisingly enjoyable,"I am not a massive fan of super hero movies - they peaked with Superman 2 in the 80's as far as I am concerned.I tend to enjoy the super hero movies that are less popular than the mainstream - The Flash, Morbius, Shazam, Thor - than the biggies.The premise of this one is as unbelievable and improbably as any of them - one needs to suspend belief and go with the flow.Some of the acting is poor. The main villain is particularly unbelievable and remarkably bereft of back story. The behaviour of the central 3 teenage characters is plain stupid - even for stupid people in movies.But its an enjoyable rollercoaster of a ride.Its suspenseful rather than a popcorn munching mainstream movie.I liked it. I hope there are sequels.Disappointed at no end credit bit."
leqesai,6,Not near as bad as people make it seem,"As of writing this review this movie currently has a 3.8 rating here on IMDB. This illustrates not only the flaw of the 0-10 star system, but a generally skewed sense of just how good/bad this movie really is.First of all, is this movie great. No, it isn't. But it sure isn't a 3.8 either. I've given this a 6 because it does some things right and some things wrong. The general story of Madame Web is interesting and its a story worth watching to see where the writers are going with the character.Anyway, I'll break down what I liked and what I didn't in a pro-con list.Pro:I enjoyed the story and development of Madame Web. Its a deviation from the comics but it works here, fairly well.The music is decent throughout. There are some timely pop songs here and there but the score itself is also decent.Madame Web's powers are also quite cool. By the end of the film I think they did a good job illustrating how powerful her precognitive power can be. Aside from some wonky cgi the last action scene is pretty fun.Con:The dub on the villain is not good.The 3 girls are not written well
Dialogue is generally high-school level (though I feel this movie is mostly targeted at a high-school audience, so this is passable)
Some of the actors are weak in their roles
Quite a few unbelievable scene interactions (especially in the first half of the movie. Dakota Johnson seems to struggle carrying lead roles like this.)In any case, it isn't a great movie but it is definitely watchable. I think people need to step away from extremely harsh or extremely positive reviews for any movie. People who gush about how much they hate/love a thing are rarely the ones that fairly describe something's quality.At the end of the day, Madame Web is a middling superhero movie right there with other Sony productions."
phantom_pixie,3,This spidermovie needs to be fumigated and tossed in the trash,"Must be so insanely frustrating for these really talented older actresses that when finally a role that is perfect for them comes along and it goes to some nepo-baby with the acting skill of a wooden bird house. On the other hand it maybe was good we didn't get Helen Mirren or Meryl Streep playing the lead, because this movie is not just badly written, badly directed and badly shot, it's terribly casted and despite having a lot of promise on the idea of a super origin story to expand the spider-verse it just misses the mark on every single shot. This spidermovie needs to be fumigated and tossed out in the trash where it belongs. Better luck next time Sony."
safwanhazza,1,I should have read the reviews before going to cinema,"Don't do my mistake, read the reviews then DON'T go and watch it.One of the worst movies I have ever watched, I was thinking of whom shall I blame for such bad picture, but I guess when the movie this bad everyone is blamed, the authors, directos, producers and actress.I believe the actress still in fifty shades of gray mood when she played an action/superhero movie, so cold and lame acting with zero expression.Moreover, the story is so weak i believe their must be more than 1 million better stories to spend money on, it is really a shame to spend all this budget on such story.Don't watch it."
Canonhead,5,Nothing to wright home to mom.,"Not sure why they made this movie. I've never heard of Madame Web. Went and watched it because there wasn't very much out there to watch for Valentine's Day. Not sure why it was released on Valentine's Day. Definitely not a love story. Lol. So not knowing anything about it made it probably more watchable. It comes across more of a thriller than an action movie. It definitely was an origin story movie, but there were five main characters, and only one origin story was told. It felt rushed, yet it was a 2hr movie. Honestly, it had the feel of a CW TV show/Netflix movie. Definitely should not have been released in theaters. I gave it a five because it passed the sleep test, meaning, I did not fall asleep and I was intrigued. The jokes feel flat the action wasn't really action. The bad guy wasn't that great of an actor. It almost felt like his voice was dubbed over. If you're wanting to get out of the house and watch a movie, this will do the trick. I just would not go watch it in IMAX like I did."
josephlogan-28785,1,WHERE IS SCOTT THE WOZ,"Im sorry but what is a spider-man movie without Scott the woz? He has made every single spider-man movie so good but since isn't in it it sucks its the worst piece of f###ing bulls##t ive ever seen take it out of cinema not even a mention about Gex or mighty no.9 NOT EVEN GLOVER OR GUBBLE!!!!! Not only they didnt have Scott the woz they didnt have stell wool the most anticipated character to come to the STWCU (scott the woz cinamatic universe), they could have at least mentioned jeb jab or the therapist r that one veagen that i dont remember the name of, im sorry but if you wanna watch a Scott the woz movie just watch. ''Scoct the woz: across the Scott verse'' or even ''Scott the woz: no way Gex''"
skylermoore,2,"Sonys, just stop","Madame Web is a film. That exists. That's the only positive I have. Never have I seen a movie of this budget be this truly horrible. Even Morbius was a masterpiece compared to this. The trailer is misleading but a better film. The acting is p**n level. It seems like no one cared, no one knew what to say, they ADR scenes it's truly amazingly awful. The cgi is poor. The writing is poor. The plot is dumb... the list truly never ends, everything bad you can imagine in a movie is present here. Characters talk in exposition dumps, I'm just not sure who let this happen. Normally I'd try better to sound professional in a review but just remembering this movie is giving me PTSD. Just stop Sony."
lassewoebken,6,Not as bad as everyone is saying,"Ok I know what you all are saying rn but hear me out. As I watched the movie it's release was already 5 weeks ago so I heard all the bad reviews wasn't expecting anything from this movie which is probably why I didn't find It THAT bad. Actually I pretty much liked watching it. Not that I would watch it again but U definitely don't regret it. For sure it's not a good SPIDERMAN movie but it's a good movie if U watch it as the movie it is. A uncomplicated, simple and not that long movie. Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney and That Rahim are extremely good actors. But at some points the script of the movie is just horrible and can't even be safed by these. Which is why I gave this Movie 6 out of 10. Have a good day fellas :)"
qgtcp,1,Awful,"This movie was so bad it made my popcorn taste bad. The dialogue was diabolical, every action sequence lacked any - and I mean ANY - urgency. Adam Scott was the only character with decent dialogue, so it's a shame he got such limited screen time.The villain's lines were dubbed onto the finished movie, leaving huge gaping errors where his mouth didn't even move! If the studio ever had hopes of making this anything other than a standalone, they've flushed that idea down the toilet!Going in, I knew it was going to be bad, but it paled to meet even my worst estimations. Poor Dakota really got shafted with a stinker on this project."
felix-53816,10,Creative and Entertaining,"As a fan of most Marvel and creative films, this film was well made, the cuts were great the plot was good in the introduction of new hero ladies, I just can't wrap my head around all the negative critiques it's as if the critics may have a lacked imagination while trying to enjoy the over entertainment of the film. The film deserves a strong nine out of ten, but gave it ten as many folks didn't give it the proper rating. There have been many Marvel films that started pretty slow and as the story matured they went to be great series. It would be pretty cool to see the second film with the sheroes yep not a word but you get it. A big Mahalos to the everyone who made this film and all the cast did very well in their roles. Again GREAT editing, special effects, acting, plot. Job Well Done."
The-Sarkologist,7,Sort of Unneccesary,"A part of me is wondering whether some of these super hero films really need to be made, though I suspect that there won't be as many made from this point on because, well, the scene has become so saturated with them that I suspect people are starting to get sick of them.This is one of those films from Sony where they are basically making films from characters that have appeared in the Spiderman universe. Mind you, a lot of them happen to be anti-heroes, though I'm not sure if that is the case with Madame Web. Actually, it seems like she is pretty much a minor character in the universe, though it appears that maybe they were trying to create the spider-women. However, I suspect that this won't be going much further.So, the story is about this woman that was born in the Peruvian Amazon where her mother was on the hunt for a spider whose poison would heal her unborn baby. It also turns out that the venom of this spider also gives people bitten by it super powers.The interesting thing that I only discovered afterwards is that some of the characters are actually from Spiderman. Like the ambulance officer is actually Peter Parker's uncle Ben (and as such the baby that is born at the end of the film is actually Peter Parker). Honestly, I didn't realise it, though it turns out that the film is set in 2003, which would make Peter 20.Anyway, the bad guy in the film had stolen the spider, but is haunted by dreams of his death. As such, he decides to go and attempt to locate the three women who would kill him, though it turns out that they are teenagers. Mind you, the whole thing about attempting to prevent his death is that he actually brings it forward, as well as bringing the three women into contact with each other.Okay, look, I didn't actually hate the film, but honestly, it certainly isn't one of the greatest, and I can see why people are starting to get sick of the whole genre."
dnaulwebb,1,So boring,"Went to watch this with my friend, we got about 30mins in and just decided to leave probably the WORST film I have ever seen. If you are going to watch this save your money, I have never been more bored in my life, tickets were decent price however when I got into the cinema it was me, my friend and one other person that says more than I need to that's how boring this monstrosity of a film was. There was no story behind the 30mins I watched, it was basically a run of knock of Spider-Man but on a budget, production could have made this film better, once again save your money and time and don't bother watching this film."
Erick_Till,1,Madame Web and The Spice Girls,"A film about women disturbed by serious psychological problems.Heroines? No. Anything but that.This is a typical new cultural order film with mostly female characters.The few men in the plot are either bad or weak or idiots.What can only happen in the eyes of a very disturbed person.These new screenwriters urgently need a psychoanalyst or rather, ""a"" female psychoanalyst because in their world a man could never be trusted.A good name for this film would be Madame Web and the Spice Girls :) It can't be more cliché, three characters with different profiles, different ethnicity (very inclusive-disgusting Disney standard). The girls are toxic, ugly, nasty, act like they are 12 years old and have serious mental problems.My God, how can someone write such rubbish? The I. Q. of that person must be lower than the ambient temperature!How could Dakota, who is a great actress, be in such trash?The script only serves to prove that writers hate men
and even so, I doubt that any woman could have loved this film.Protect your neurons!"
filmtravel101,2,Madame Boredom baby sitting fest - terrible script-acting,Unfortunately this script is more of a silly tv movie that has terrible casting of Dakota Johnson acting as a baby sitter to some teenagers that have no personalities because the script is beyond repair. Half of the audience was laughing at how stupid it sounded and by the 3rd act people were snoring. It's a real shame as I really like both Dakota and Sweeney but this was not a good match for anyone since the script and concept is better suited for a tv series and not a film. Plus the entire concept of having flash forward deja vu clairvoyant abilities gets old and bland quickly putting an audience into a sleeping nightmare where you want a refund.It's like a cross of spider man/teens meets adventures in baby sitting with a female Next concept that is stuck in replay mode. How on earth did the writers get approval of this script unless it was another Covid disaster script.2 stars for the sexy teen outfits and goofy spidermen.
jcbrownlie,3,What was the point?,"Only 2 words can describe this movie for mePointless
And
AwfulShocked I didn't walk out! Save your money, but more importantly you time. Its 2 hours of your life that you won't get back.The best part of this movie were the pre movie trailers. Some of those movies actually looked good, and may actually have a decent premise, or even better....a point! 2 hours went by (slowly) and I kept waiting for something, anything atvall to happen. I only gave it a 3 out of pure kindness...it honestly deserved lower. Marvel has to have a hard look at projects they green light...I literally could have sneezed a better plot line.Avoid."
ysonu-86423,1,Wasted my 1 hour,"Don't bother watching this movie as it is the worst and most ridiculous plot nonsense movie with no logic whatsoever. It is the worst movie of marvel universe so dont waste time watching this crap. This movie has no plus points but hundreds of cons including poor storyline, poor direction and worst cast except the lead actress with no acting skills at all so dont bother watching this no logic movie. No doubt why majority of users rated it very poorly. The director made this movie with no logic at all where the story lines remain poor to watch the movie. The villain is himself a joke and thus story becomes weak and ridiculous."
walterhalstead,6,Web Of Shadows,"This film is good, but it could have been great. The first half sets you up for something that never happens but that will happen in a future film which is kind of a letdown, but overall not a bad film.I also can't stress how refreshing it is to see a super hero film in this day and age where I don't have to see 20+ other movies and/or shows in order to fallow the thing. You can just enjoy this as its own stand alone film and it is all the better for it.I think it is safe to say a lot of people wanted to hate this movie well before it came out and there is a lot of bias at play here with the reviews against it. See it for yourself and make up your own mind. Don't be a sheep that follows trolls."
ddoncer-57936,1,"I wish I could put a 0 but I couldn't, so I give it a 1","The worst movie i have ever watched, down to the acting, writing, directing, and camera work are all awful. The main villain is very forgettable, and had the worst motive ever. And the movie wasn't funny bad like Morbius, it just had me mad at the end. I first watched the trailer of this movie and didn't think it was going to be good, I just thought it was going to be mid, but I didn't think it would be this bad. I Would never watch again, and would never put anyone of this torture. And to the directors, why did you make this, who ask for this. And this isn't because they are women, It's because the movie is just awful."
chris_adams100,8,Better than I thought,"Went in expecting a car crash came out thinking it wasn't too bad, All the reviews point to it being trash, I can see what they were trying to do just a shame it won't continue after the ratings. Hopefully it will do a morbius and do well on streaming or Netflix - could make a good tv series but I think this will be the end of it all.let's see what happens when they finally bring Spider-Man 4 into the fold - and then what will venom 3 brings and if any of these spider girls will ever do anything in any other movie who knows but I doubt it. Go in and watch the film and don't read the reviews. And see if you like."
knocknoc01,7,It was pretty good,"I have no idea why people were hating on this movie. I thought it was entertaining. The acting seemed just fine, the ending was great. I have no idea if the CGI was any good because I cant tell good CGI from bad. I dont know nor do I care if it followed the source material, all I cared about was did I come away liking it & the answer to that is Yes.I would like a sequel but with the low ratings it seems unlikely. By the way for those rating this a 1 star, you have got to be out of your mind, this isn't even close to being a 1 star movie. My guess is you are 20 something year olds who have never seen Barbarella or Battlefield Earth. I've watched some real bad movies and this isn't one of them."
matt_jacobs1,5,The Screenplay Writers.,"How the writers are still getting work I'll never know. Just to put it into perspective, they also wrote Morbius, the Power Rangers movie, and a whole host of god awful movies that bombed in the box office.Why did Sony think it was a good idea to hire them? They clearly have no clue how to write a decent screenplay, and the recent reviews provides even more evidence of this.I wanted to like this movie. I've only rated it a 6/10 because I feel bad for the actors having to work with a shoddy screenplay...they deserved better!The movie sets up a sequel, but tbh I don't think we'll actually get to see it, which is both shame and a blessing.Sony. Stop hiring these incompetent writers!"
mrfri,1,Worst marvel movie.,"Ranks dead last in Marvel movies. I can't believe this movie was even released. They should have scrapped it after watching. I can't say enough bad things about this garbage: laughable, corny dialogue, terrible script and story, terrible acting. No point to the movie what so ever. We've seen all these scenes and plot lines before. Web offers us nothing new to the genre. Don't waste your time. Marvel studios needs to stop insulting the intelligence of it's audience. The business itself deserves to lose money after years of horrible junk movies that are not meant to entertain, but con jobs to get us to buy tickets."
steviegjd,3,Not a good movie,"I don't know this from the comics. But I generally enjoy superhero movies. I came to this with an open mind. But this is not a good movie.The story is convoluted. The script is poor. The editing is terrible.I like the idea of the main character and the three potential sidekicks. I think it could have been campy fun. The acting was inconsistent. Dakota Johnson is kind of flat, as was one of the girls. The other two girls are better.While it was entertaining at times, it is so inconsistent that as a whole it's pretty poor. It actually makes The Marvels look good.That is not an endorsement."
waltermwilliams,3,What Walt's Watching,"Dakota Johnson as ""Madame Web"" is fifty shades of beige!Let's face it so is the whole movie.The average rating on IMDb is 3.8 after nearly 20,000 views.This in itself should be a huge red flag to Sony not to make a sequel to this stinking pile of excrement.US Actress Sydney Sweeney must be regretting her decision to sign on for this project as ""Julia"" considering her acting career was on a huge trajectory with the success of Australia's second highest grossing romcom ever ""Anyone But You"" which is box office gold...see it instead.First time director S. J. Clarkson should have stuck to directing TV series it seems more her jam.Meanwhile the team of writers including Clarkson need to go back to attending Creative Writing Workshops or avoid using AI programmes in future screenplays.Meanwhile Emma Roberts is playing ""Mary Parker"" mum to be of ""Peter Parker"".That name ring any bells in the Spider Verse?Her on screen brother ""Ben Parker"" is Adam Scott (""Parks & Recreation"") who'd be ideally suited to impersonate Alan Alder (because of his voice) if they ever make another M. A. S. H. movie or his biopic.Talking voices the Archetypal villain of this project ""Ezekiel Sims"" (Tatar Rahim) must have had his speech dubbed in post production or it's just annoyingly distracting.The movie is very loosely based on the Marvel comic ""The Book of Ezekiel"".Mike Epps is wasted as Paramedic ""O'Neil"" and used in only 2 scenes.Don't expect to see Spider-Man either.It is the fourth overall film of Sony's Spider-Man Universe movies without Spider-Man following Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage and Morbius.BTW Product placement is at an all time high with the Neon Pepsi Sign in the final act.Dumb Stuff:
1. How can you drive around New York in a stolen Yellow Cab with no number plates and a smashed up front end and still not attract one of NYPD's finest to book you?2. Where did the Forest/Jungle near a Retro NY Diner come from?3. Why does the Peruvian Jungle look like Mexico with fake signage?4. 3 Teens are abducted and willingly go along with Madame Web ""Cassandra Webb"" (Dakota) because she demonstrates signs of clairvoyance.Things can only get better right?Wrong!I smell what you're stepping in.Madame Web"" is one of the lowest grossing Marvel Studios movie ever.Here's hoping the new ""Deadpool & Wolverine"" movie can save this company's nose dive in 2024.After all ""Deadpool"" is the self proclaimed ""Messiah or Marvel Jesus"".It's such a shame that ""Madame Web"" was the first film to use the Columbia Pictures 100th anniversary opening logo to celebrate the studio's centennial anniversary.This once great film company of course was swallowed up by the corporate giant Sony.""Madame Web"" is 80 million dollars the Sony big wigs will have to write off their books in 2024.According to the movie's tagline ""Madame Web"" connects them all.If Web really had the powers of clairvoyance, she should have seen this coming.God help this franchise."
phoneticnachos,1,"Bad script, worse actors, terrible SFX, we want more R movies like Deadpool","Nothing of value can be said about this movie, they ruined a beloved character from the old spiderman cartoon, that old lady was cool.Why are you unable to stick to the facts of the cartoons we Millennials grew up on when you make these remakes?So many poor casting choices, why all these no-name untalented people? Pick people with real acting training and experience, they all acted like they were filming cringe social media posts and just posing for the camera.Full of plot holes, Marvel has gone so far down hill since the Avenger movies, even the other releases the last few years have been bad.They keep making these cheesy cringe kid type shows, when we keep telling them to make more R rated films like Deadpool.Adults built this industry, stop making little kid stuff."
mamiashapakidze,5,Worse than Morbius?,"I was looking forward to going into cinema and busting my gut at how bad it would be as we did on Morbius. I am disappointed it was not nearly as bad, honestly the only bad thing about it was the puddle shallow villain and the weird spire lore from deep in the jungle. Main cast did good job at projecting disharmony and tripping mismatch. Where they cast into cliche roles - yeees! No doubt; was the climax stupid? Absolutely! Is it the worst we have seen? No; Im sure the movies they have planned to launch based on this movie will certainly reach the coveted nadir by turning into what black Panther 2 turned into- power rangers."
etgrawe,7,"It wasn't great, but it was also nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be.","Nowhere near as bad as people were making it sound. It certainly wasn't the best movie out there, but it was perfectly watchable. I thought the concept was pretty cool and it occasionally had some good action sequences. The dialogue was a bit clunky though and the acting was a bit stiff. Also the girls were massively underused. They had no personalities and contributed nothing to the plot aside from being in danger. They also don't even acquire powers at any point which was like the whole driving force behind the movie. The villain was pretty over the top in this movie as well. Like, he was comically evil and had basically no backstory. It's not even that clear why he stole the spider powers in the first place. I'm not sure that the Peruvian spider-people were really necessary. To me they just made everything seem really corny but whatever, Spiderman movies have always been pretty corny. I think this movie has been criticized a bit too harshly. It wasn't amazing but I still thought it was pretty enjoyable and I would totally watch a sequel if they made one."
jesseferguson-89827,1,Madam boring and 3 whining idiots,"If I could write boring 600 times on this review it would be more entertaining than this movie. ""Who are you, what is going on?"" Not just a quote from the movie but what I was thinking for the first 50 minutes. When Cassie leaves the three girls in the woods I was hoping for a horror movie. None of these characters are likable, interesting, or intelligent. So glad Cassie went to her apartment to read a book out loud. Yawn, did the director ever watch a movie. This is the biggest piece of poop since the Marvels. The diner scene "" Let's sit at the bar"", how about ""let's sit at the counter."" I don't think the director has ever eaten at an actual restaurant. This movie is bad. I don't even know the 3 girl's name, oh wait Cassie doesn't either. What restaurant lets people dance on the table. This movie is so unrealistic and ridiculous, bad acting, bad directing, bad action. Cassie kidnapped 3 minors, steals a taxicab, and drives through a restaurant. Then she takes 3 minors to a shady hotel, creepy. They are all orphans no surprise there, who would want to adopt any of these morons. These 3 morons are being taught CPR, they should try acting classes. I don't know why ""the bad guy is chasing"" the girls and it's 1:17 minutes in. Save two hours and don't watch this garbage. Oh boy she can see 5 minutes before anything happens, that power is horrible, not strong not fast, can't fight. Miss Cleo, a spokeswoman for a psychic pay-per-call-minute service called Psychic Readers Network, in a series of television commercials that aired from 1997 to 2003 would be better."
karlayala-324-149205,8,"It's actually entertaining, what's wrong with the nerds?","Had really low expectations for this movie after watching q couple reviews on YouTube and reading review here but I was pleasantly surprised.Seems like people won't leave room for anything but canon timeline stories. I have hated everything marvel has put out there lately but this was actually enjoyable.Dakota acting is pretty good. Cinematic filming looks good too. The Visuals and they way they portrait the visions of the future were pretty compelling. If you are a regular human being who actually enjoy entertaining films without being obsessed or toxic superhero fan, you could easily give this movie a chance and enjoy it on you free day."
arcelivez-753-983928,6,The movie is not as bad as the rating says,"Honestly, the movie wasn't that bad. Definitely doesn't deserve to have its rating below 4 as it currently is... Should easily be over 5. Maybe 5.2-5.5... It was an OK, or a somewhat good movie. Not a great movie. It had a slightly dull vibe, but the scenario, even if sometimes not logical (well it's not logical in certain aspects but, hey, it's never really logical in these movies), it was quite original I would say, I have seen lots of movies and I had not seen like that. It was also quite humourous. Overall I and my girlfriend liked the movie, definitely not an awful one, even if the rating says it's awful... But of course this movie is not marvel grade."
Sandro_1981,5,Another mediocre to weak written superhero movie,"Went to see this movie last night. First of I must say that I saw worse Superhero movie, up 'till now the Flash is the worst for me.As far as staying true to the original content (comics) i can't comment since I'm not familiar with them. The main inconsistency was that, it is said this movie is set in the same universe and before the ""Tobey McGuire"" Spiderman movie.But in 2003 Spiderman already existed and in Madame Webb (also set in 2003) peter Parker is born????? Did I miss something here???Furthermore i thought it was a mediocre Superhero movie wich is the norm lately, sad but true. But as I said it was at best Ok to watch."
sgildea-78306,2,2 because there's moving pictures of Sydney Sweeney.,"But there's no substance.This is a terrible film in all ways.I had heard of it getting bad reviews but hadn't read any myself but now I wish I could had.This film isn't worth watching even out of curiosity. It's bad.The acting from the villain should mean he never gets hired for anything with a budget over £100 ever again. Truly awful performance he should be embarrassed by.The action scenes weren't entertaining in the slightest, no tension or any real sense that the characters were in danger at any point.The special effects weren't special, the story was boring and had no other strands to it. It was so linear and obvious.Just simply an awful movie and it makes me fear that the studios really are run by some absolute jokers who employ people for the wrong reasons to write this crap.Oh and please, please stop with the political nonsense. Being shoehorned into every single film. It's beyond belief now.Don't watch this, otherwise you'll feel dumber. It's killed a few of my brain cells I swear."
ACollegeStudent,2,Common Sony L,"Rating: 2.0A good old-fashioned dumpster fire. This is fundamentally terrible due to the lack of narrative tension: (you know nothing of consequence will happen to anyone because you get spoilers due to Webb's ability every 20-ish minutes). Completely unlikeable characters, an unengaging villain: he wanted the spider powers to build his off-screened empire and didn't like Madam Webb's mom because her ""path was clear cut"" and he came from nothing?? He's also a moron who couldn't even hire a team of people to track down the girls and pinned it all on one person. Nonsensical plot points: the entire teen diner scene, as well as the spider people not protecting the spiders allowing them to be stolen despite acknowledging with great power comes great responsibility, why did they only step in when Madam Webb's mom was going to die? Weird product placement: The villain was defeated by a Pepsi sign; and clunky informal dialogue. This isn't even considering how it breaks Spider-Man canon as a prequel. You're better off watching Morbius at least that was funny."
davemcdo,3,At least it's not...,"""The Marvels"".It's not great but not anywhere near as bad as ""The Marvels"" which was probably the worst movie I've seen.The acting by both Johnson and Sweeney is a bit dodgy, the story is nothing new and the finale is boring and predictable in a Marvel setting up a sequel way.I went to see it because of all the terrible reviews and my ""want to walk out"" benchmark was ""The Marvels"" and thankfully it's a lot better than than that, not a great recommendation but it's at least watchable.However it's sad when you leave a movie thinking why bother making it, it added nothing new to the Marvel Universe, it's all been done before and much better, and it's wasting resources that could be spent on making a proper interesting movie."
sofiedbl,2,9 year olds can write the same movie,"It's so predictable, so basic and it felt like the movie took a decade to end.Also julia gives so much pick me girl vibes.It feels like a bunch of 9 year olds wrote this movie.The acting was mid, just like a theatre piece that school forces you to watch.To be honest i think that the roblox kids could make the exact same movie but with way worse cgi. Like yeah cgi is mid but the plot needs to be good and not bad. It feels like y'all locked up the writers with claustrophobia in the basement so they'll give you a mid script.Sony just needs to stop making these bad movies that no one cares about it's pathetic, Sony."
novakid-72908,3,Was like a TV Pilot for a show I'd still watch,"Wow. This film has received shed loads of criticism and yet I watched it. The idea of showing the superpower of clairvoyance or premonitions is not easy to pull off. First issue is slow down and don't put your money shots in the first 15 minutes. Give people more to care about and more jeopardy. The opening was rushed and the villain needed better actor and less derivative visual representation. Some originality.If you're going to spend 90% of the screen time with 4 people (Webb and the Spider-girls), developing interesting discourse and unpacking their stories has to be more than just bad dialogue and stupid choices. I'm not going to waste time saying what many others have pointed out. This isn't the story of the spider-girls and yet the absence of their story arcs being fulfilling, the forcing in of the Uncle Ben arc (didn't bother me too much) and the many plot holes. (Trip to Peru when you are on the run for kidnapping - which would have been resolved in 5 minutes at a police station especially in a world where supers already exist - for a 5 minute character development scene). The girls manage to stay off baddies radar for a week when previously incapable of it for an hour.So it is a gigantic mess. But it does tug at the strings if things that I'd like to see develop.Don't bring back the villain. Do find an interesting way to give each of the spider-girls their powers and work for Miss Webb. If she opens a brothel and they start working johns, then she will be ""Madame Webb"".The early shot of the girls in costume and using powers would've served better as a post credit scene of them taking down a decent spider verse villain.It's the least superpowered origin story but didn't own that. Camera work need to slow down, stop trying to rotate around action. Better script, villain and edit and this could've been something better.However, is it the worst Sony - Superflick. Nope. That still belongs to Venom 2: Let there be rubbish."
Chalice_Of_Evil,7,Webheads...,"The movie begins in 1973, where a pregnant Constance Webb (Kerry BishÃ©) is searching for a rare type of spider to help cure a disease it's later revealed her unborn child has when she's betrayed by the man assisting her, Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim), who kills a bunch of people, shoots Constance in a scuffle, and steals the special spider she's caught. Peruvian spider people whisk her away and are able to deliver her child, but Constance doesn't make it (can't imagine why being bitten by a spider probably wasn't enough to save her...but it *does* have an effect on her child). Cut to 2003, where her grown-up daughter, Cassandra 'Cassie' Webb (Dakota Johnson), is working as a paramedic alongside Ben Parker (Adam Scott), brother-in-law to Mary Parker (Emma Roberts) who is pregnant with a certain future web-slinger. While attempting to save someone who's been in a car accident, Cassie's in an accident herself, plunging into water inside a car which triggers something and suddenly she starts experiencing future visions that start off very abstract, but then later are presented to us as watching the same events play out in a Final Destination-ish/Groundhog Day-esque kinda way. Going into this movie, I knew very little about the comic book character of Madame Web other than the fact that she's supposed to be a lot older than she's presented here.Unlike others, I wasn't bothered by Dakota Johnson's casting one bit. She'd managed the impossible task of bringing some actual humanity to her character in the Fifty Shades movies, and I don't think she's given enough credit for her comedic skills in those. It's a shame she wasn't given more opportunity to show them off here, as she gets the odd sarcastic line, but the *one* genuinely amusing moment in the movie shows she can pull off physical comedy as well (the scene with her failed wall-climbing). Meanwhile, spider-enhanced Ezekiel's also seeing flashes of the future which show his death caused by three masked girls, and with the help of his technology assistant, Amaria (Zosia Mamet), he eventually tracks them down and tries to kill them before they can kill him. The only thing keeping them alive is Cassie...not that they make it easy for her by disobeying her simple safety instructions. Of the three, Julia Cornwall (Sydney Sweeney) is easily the best/most likeable, as she's the one who expresses *appreciation* to Cassie for saving their lives, wants to listen to what she has to say and is empathetic, showing concern for/caring about others. She's actually NICE.At the other end of the spectrum is Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor), who right from her introduction, giving the finger to Cassie (who I was in total agreement with when she remarked, ""Who flips off an ambulance? Kids these days!""), isn't very likeable at all. She also sits on tables in trains instead of the chairs, threatens to press charges against Cassie for stealing her skateboard (which was the only way Cassie could get her to move when she was in the process of SAVING HER LIFE) despite the fact that Mattie had just been antagonizing cops at the train station beforehand, eats the only food the girls have when they're dumped in the forest, and exposes them by not keeping her head down. It's not until fairly late into the movie that Mattie becomes tolerable, where she actually appears to have grown to *care* about the other girls (though her continual denying Cassie a high-five remains annoying, considering everything she does to keep them safe).The third girl, Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), is probably given the least amount of focus/development. She starts out being the most at odds with Mattie, but like all of them winds up being somewhat useful in the climactic battle against Ezekiel (though chest compression lessons are the REAL hero!). By the time all these women are working together as one, the movie's nearly over. The biggest 'negative' of this movie is its villain. Ezekiel's your typical cardboard cutout villain uttering unimaginative dialogue, but a better actor could've at least done SOMETHING with the material given. Unfortunately, Rahim brings nothing to the role except a gruff voice. He's about as boring a villain as they come. As usual with female-led movies, there're those over-exaggerating how 'bad' it is. I believe a lot of people trashing this movie went into it *wanting* to hate it (some probably even made up their minds about it as soon as it was first announced), but for those who were willing to at least give it a chance...I think the biggest disappointment is that it's not the superheroine movie we were led to believe.While it's probably not what a lot of people were expecting, it's not as 'terrible' as it's being made out to be. It's just a different sort of movie to what had been presented in the trailers and it probably would've been better to advertise it as what is really is...which isn't so much of a 'superhero movie', but more just a movie about strangers coming together against a common enemy. Those who hate the SSU (Sony's Spider-Man Universe) or movies centred on female protagonists..this movie clearly isn't for you. Those expecting the three female characters to become the costumed superheroes we got glimpses of in the trailers will likely be disappointed since what was in those trailers is pretty much all you get of them suited up and with powers in the movie. Apart from two brief visions of the future (the first is early in the film and the second's at the very end), the three ladies remain normal, without powers/costumes. Really, if you removed all the spider-related stuff, it'd probably work as just a movie about a bad dude hunting women and them trying to stay alive. The lesson to be learned here is don't save all the actual costumed superhero stuff for a sequel you mightn't even get (which is likely going to be the case here)."
masonsaul,4,Bad in a fun way,"Madame Web is a comic book movie assembled from spare parts. Incompetent in its plot, editing and its obsession with Spider-Man whilst still being too scared to even mention him by name. However, as a throwback to the early 2000s era of comic book movies with enough enjoyably bad moments it can at least rise above Morbius.Dakota Johnson gives a fascinating performance that is simultaneously so disinterested in everything and occasionally holding the whole thing together. Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor are all given very thinly sketched caricatures that they and their chemistry can only do so much with.Tahar Rahim's performance might be a new low for villains in cinema. Undoubtedly done dirty by the ADR that isn't even trying to sync up with what's on screen but even without that every single line is so stilted in his delivery. He's so one note and considering that one note is irredeemably evil it's distracting how little presence he has.S. J. Clarkson is director, co-writer and an executive producer which still wasn't enough for any vision to survive into the final product, which is factory assembled all the way down to the poorly rendered, CG heavy finale. That being said, the majority of it relying on sets and locations means it crosses a bar that depressingly few recent films in this genre have been able to."
jzer0,8,I know nothing of the source material,"I went in to this movie expecting a train wreck of a film and left pleasantly surprised. It felt like a movie that should have come out in the time that it was taking place. 2003 I believe? I wish this could have been handled by someone like Sam Raimi who could have amped up the horror elements as well as the humor.When compared to something like Happy Death Day, Before I Fall or some other Groundhog Day horror film I think I it truly stands out.The dialog is cheesy and the audio isn't always synced up but the female cast is great. Parts of it actually reminded me of Dark Angel. There isn't a lot of depth, most of the cheesy and eye rolling moments are saved for the end of the film.I recommend it to people who want to see a cheesy ""thriller"" it's also fairly kid safe."
Elvis-Del-Valle,7,"It's not bad actually, it's just misunderstood.","Madame Web is a character that very few know either from the comics or from the Spiderman animated series of the 90s. Knowing how she is like, there wasn't much need to make a movie about Madame Web, but they decided to do it anyway. The film presents a version of Madame Web with an origin story somewhat different from that of the comics, but retaining some elements of her character. The film falls short of meeting certain expectations of what many expect from a Marvel film, but this alternate universe produced by Sony shows a different approach.The films of this universe were made according to the focus and nature of the main characters. The Venom movies were made based on the character's personality and humor. Morbius was made as a more updated vampire movie. The thing about Madame Web is that it was made as a supernatural thriller. It is a basic film without much to go into depth that seems to return to those superhero movies made in the 2000s like Daredevil, Catwoman or Elektra. The way Cassandra Web's clairvoyance is handled makes the film partly a thriller almost in the style of Stephen King's The Dead Zone. A notable change in this film is its lore where the Spiderman myth is more oriented toward the supernatural than science fiction. The film does have an interesting story, but wild camera movements and some inexplicable scenes make the film look strange. The script change that was made during filming is not very noticeable, but there are a couple of flaws in the script and in the dialogue. The director of this film had previously participated in Jessica Jones and The Defenders and it should not be a challenge for her to have made this film, but since her entire career was only limited to television productions, it is clear that her first work in a film for cinemas it was not going to be easy.We are introduced to 3 Spider-Women and we have already seen one of them in Across The Spidervese, but it must be clarified that they do not come into action because this is an origin story that focuses mostly on Cassandra and not on the girls she protects. Let's say this movie is a kind of pilot episode for some future Spider-Women saga, so you can't expect much. The trailer and advertising was quite misleading because some expected to see the Spider-Women in action, but obviously that was not going to be the case. You can understand that disappointment.The villain of the story is Ezekiel Sims, who already had a cameo in Across The Spiderverse and here they decided to give him a suit almost similar to that of Miles Morales. Admittedly, Ezekiel is a little clumsy here and isn't very intimidating. Although most of the actresses fit the characters well, the best of the cast is undoubtedly Dakota Johnson, who has gained fame thanks to the Fifty Shades Of Gray saga or the remake of Suspiria. She fits in well as Cassandra Web, but it's a shame she didn't have such a good time on set. One thing that's very fascinating is that we're introduced to a young Uncle Ben as Cassandra's sidekick and Peter Parker's mother, which helps provide a tie-in to The Amazing Spider-Man even though they wanted this movie to stand alone. Cassandra's friendship with Ben Parker is a good indication of how Madame Web relates to Spiderman.In conclusion, Madame Web is not better than Morbius, but she does not deserve so much rejection. It is a simple and easy to digest film that manages to entertain. It should even have a sequel to see more about the Spider-Women, but apparently that will be difficult due to low acceptance. In the end it is not a bad movie, people simply saw it with the wrong perspective and failed to understand that it is something different to introduce a part of the Spider-People that we need to know. In fact, since they introduced us to the Spiderverse, they left open the possibility of knowing the different versions of Spiderman that exist and it is a vast universe that is interesting to know. It is best to watch Madame Web taking into account that it is a supernatural thriller and a pilot that focuses more on the origin of Madame Web and not on the Spider-Woman, that will obviously be reserved for a possible future film. My final rating for this movie is a 7/10, which is certainly more valid than all the bad ratings it has received."
SSJAWSUM,1,Worse than you think...,"Go ahead, and watch this movie. I encourage you to. I knew it was bad going in, but wow was I surprised at the new low this movie reached.But I now have a newer, fresher perspective on movies that are very well done, and have passion behind them. The sterile vapid content of MADAME WEB is insulting to the viewer, Marvel fan or not, and there isn't an ounce of redemption throughout, all the way to the end when you hate yourself a little more.Now go watch anything else that has some effort behind it, and it will be that much better to enjoy. MADAME WEB might just be the worst theatrical release of the past 2 - 3 years, and there is nobody who would argue otherwise."
goeteyngunther,1,Might be the worst thing I saw,"Where to start.Her powers are CPR and precise ambulance driving. The girls have no powers.Worst villian i've seen who nerfes himself constantly.""When you take on the responsibility great power will come""Horrible writing. Nonsensical camera 180's and zoom ins,.No chemistry between the actorsNo fun after credit's (wasn't anything memorable in the film for a callback)This is the first review im writing just because this should really not have been made. This is a lack of vision and overarching direction. They need someone knowledgable at helm of Sony if they want to keep making spidermans."
xerof,1,Wanna punish someone? Make them sit through this whole movie!,"Do these people think we are dumb? I mean, seriously! There's a limit to being a bad movie.

Do't get me started on the camera movements! But casting was good.Here I am doing you a favor, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME! Yeah, its that bad!You think Morbius was bad, nah! Morbius is a freaking masterpiece compared to this garbage.And also, don't bring 'women empowerment' here. A movie is a good movie when its a good movie!"
MFBOS42,4,Huge disappointment,"Nothing worse than watching a movie and realizing all of the good parts were in the trailers. And realizing there's nothing about the movie that is even remotely entertaining accept what's in the trailers. They could have made a movie and had flashbacks to create that boring ass origin story. Sony, if you're going to make terrible movies as usual, give up the rights to people that actually want to make a movie. These actresses deserve much better. This was a piss poor attempt at a superhero movie at absolute best. Sad really. And to think I couldn't wait to see this. Waste of $20. Thanks {{{facepalm}}}"
djjimmyd,3,Confusing. Bad story bad ideas.,"Grade: D
Couple problems with this movie. It's not Spider-Man. Very close though. The teenagers just run around and scream in this movie they don't really do anything. And I don't understand how this villain can do what he do and how he became who he is and where did he come from. Does he even have a name? There's just no background. Things are not explained that well in this movie. So you can watch it with confusion and you keep waiting for something exciting to happen... Nothing exciting happens. Apparently marvel thought this story was good enough to make the movie about they should have sent it back to the drawing board! Maybe if they had some cameos it could have saved this movie but they didn't even do that."
Jpoppccp,1,Embarrassing,"As a lover of exciting superhero movies I must say this wasn't even a comedic spoof, much less a genuine superhero movie. The storyline is all over the place. I feel embarrassed for the creators / writers and not to mention the actors.NOW, as a career Paramedic...What in God's name were y'all trying to accomplish with this absurdity? I used to think Waking the Dead was the biggest joke, but this one trumped it by several miles. I started out laughing, but then I realized y'all were trying to be serious. Wow...There was some positives I guess. The actors were actually great. You can tell they really applied themselves to be believable.Anyway, didn't have much else to do and Dakota Johnson is easy to watch so I can say I watched it..."
mrsshortridge,7,Not horrible,"A few of the reviews are very negative. I just watched this movie tonight.Did I enjoy the story? Yes
Could it have been better? Yes
Was it the worst movie made? No
I have watched my handful of movies in my life.... I do wish there would have been more.... Of something, I just don't know what....... For me, it is a good breaking the ice for what this movie can grow to be. I do wish Dokota was a little more into her role. I didn't feel she showed her full potential. I think Sidney did good, and she's got her other movie ""anyone but you"" still in the theater.I do hope to see a second one in the future, with just more of everything...."
phzgnkn,4,So where the web?,"Huge fan of the second Spider Woman
Julie Carpenter from her run with the Avengers West Coast to her own mini series she had
Now making her debut on this film really was a bad idea theres so many errors that the film has that really the screen writers don't know where to take the movie.First the convulated premonition that were a mess that even the actress didn't know what to do about it.Then the cast there was no connection with the girl's each personality n tropes that one wait for but didn't work out.Then the villain wasn't that good not even he's motive that's only make him one dimensional
I heard of this character from the comics but seriously they took their time don't know where they were headed.To conclude the film had good premise but they didn't work well with the story n the cast
There's many things they could work but they prefer to rush it into theaters, then suit confuse to know where they from. N didn't sayz."
vxzyvwt,9,People are ridiculous with what they post,"Listen.... This is not an average endgame action type movie, but I can honestly say it's a breath of fresh air from marvel and the story line is really good. I hope they make a sequel because this can go own to be awesome.I'm so confused why all the reviews are blasting this movie? It has everything in my opinion which you would want in a movie. It has a good villain with a good story line and solid acting. This movie is actually a lot more dark and violent then most marvel movies I have seen recently.If I could pick out 1 thing that maybe could have been better I would say tell a little more history about the spider that gives the powers and how they found them."
yellowmarlin,6,An improvement on what came before,"Ignore all of the one, two and three star reviews dragging this movie's rating down; it's nowhere near as bad as that. In fact, it's a considerable improvement on Sony's previous offerings Venom (I skipped the sequel) and Morbius. Is it perfect? Of course not. In fact, there are several glaring plot holes and inconsistencies glossed over in order to advance the plot. Is it fun? Yes, it is. Here's what it's got going for it: this is a Spider-Man movie in which the spider man character is the villain, it gives us an origin story/mythology for the power-imbuing arachnid, and the precognitive abilities of Cassie Webb allow for some entertaining action sequences. I look forward to seeing the various Spider-Women again in the future."
jkb2012,5,In assistance with Marvel not an actual Marvel,As someone who is a massive Spiderman fan I do not at all understand what the problem is with this film because I personally think that it does not deserve all the bad reviews it gets it is not a Marvel movie at all just because it's set in the world of Spiderman doesn't mean in what movie if you actually watch the movie it says in assistance with Marvel it's Sony not Marvel and I think it was still a fun movie and Dakota Johnson didn't do that bad of a job and even though in the comics she's older at least she still goes blind and her powers get enhanced which is really cool It might get a sequel.
diazjoshua-25438,1,Disgustingly bad,"Everything about this movie was disgustingly bad!!! The acting was bad, the plot was terrible, and the writing was an embarrassment to movie writers. If I could give this joke of a movie -10 I would. From start to finish, it was a head scratcher. I literally laughed out loud during the movie when it was a mess.The details of this movie were sloppy. The ambulance scene had police sirens instead of ambulance sirens. The production cost for correct sirens is nothing. The plot of this movie takes place in 2003 yet when they show the surrounding scenery, it's clearly the 2020's.The actors lines in this movie were so bad it made me and my wife look at each other and laugh. It was just horrible.In all, they should delete this movie from existence."
thomasrokusek,1,Absolute junk! Glad I didn't spend money on it.,"This movie is the worse superhero movie I've ever seen. It makes The Batman look like a piece of art. Seriously though, if you are in the mood to watch a movie that produced in English but sound like it dubbed over in English then this is the movie for you. If you are interested in watching a movie that has some of the worst acting, then this is the movie for you. It's like all the actors and actresses only are half into it. To top it all off the guy who plays the villain is a horrible actor. There is very little charisma between most of the actors and a lot of the scenes just seem out of place."
a_wals,1,Stan Lee is turning in his grave right now,"Ever since Stan Lee pasted away, it is only getting worse with Marvel.With all the so called good cast, you think it is promising, but unfortunately not.It was so bad, that I turned it off 20 minutes in.Don't waist any precious time.Casting sucks, dialogues sucks, chemistry sucks and I can continue, but there will be no web left.CGI looks good though, but that's the only plus.How is it possible to put in so much money and get such a bad result?I feel bad for the few good actors who played in this movie, although I wasn't in long enough to see them play their part.I had to write 600 words, so now I'm done."
KingFlowers2509,5,Interesting,"It was ight, the script was ðŸ’€ The production was chefs kiss. This was my first time learning about Madamw Web so as a first timer it was a cool introduction. Past that the script just felt bleh. There was barely any chemistry between the talent, it felt like people were being forced to speak here. What could have helped this film was having everyone do research on the characters that way everything could be connected way better and even more moments could have happened. The humor in here was dry, when people are comfortable around eachother humorous moments happen so much better then what we see. This should've been a tv series instead like Morbius, both of them had me say "" Wait that's it?"" When it was over."
gareth-75442,1,"""Cringefest"" is too kind a word for this abomination.","With a script that seems to have been written by a pre pubescent child from a fan comic pulled from a waste bin, Madame Web is as cringe as cringe can be.Sony have managed to sink lower than any other studio with their latest offering.Between the mid seventies and early nineties both CBS & Universal studios released TV shows & TV movies of Marvel characters that to this day puts Sonys latest effort firmly in the garbage pile.Truly I feel sorry for Adam Scott, this wretched excuse for cinema is now on his resume and that is so unfair, he did not deserve this.There is not a single scene in the entire movie that is worth watching, every aspect of the story is nonsense.Apart from Scott doing his best with an awful script and terrible story there isn't a single actor that shows any attempt to actually act.Sonys attempt to create a Spiderverse with the absence of spiderman is probably one of the most moronic decisions they could have made, spiderman is unique, from his origin to his fully developed abilities, Madam Web does nothing but water down that uniqueness by adding the nonsense of the spider-people of Peru and adding a spiderman like villain with a carbon copy spider suit decades before the Peter parker spiderman even exists.This movie truly deserves to be the flopbuster that it is, it deserves every negative criticism that's hurled it's way.Sony have created a masterpiece of garbage."
wolfe-andrew,7,I actually enjoyed it,"I thought it was pretty cool, how she could see the future, but in a very unclear way. And how fate worked to bring all the characters together.I think it was a perfectly good ""1st movie"" in a potential series, where time is taken to get to know the characters, and the plot is somewhat deliberate, and not too grandiose.I don't quite understood the large magnified of low reviews. Yes, it's not a perfect movie, and at least it was entertaining, somewhat unique, and a movie doesn't have to be perfection explainable of executed to he enjoyable.I thought the acting was good enough, and the plot wasn't too telegraphed."
bileyassein,2,Worst marvel movie after Morbius,"This latest addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, 'Madame Web,' unfortunately, fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors.As a dedicated fan of the franchise, I eagerly anticipated this release, only to find myself sorely disappointed. The writing lacks the depth and complexity that typically characterize Marvel films, resulting in a storyline that feels shallow and underdeveloped. The storytelling itself feels disjointed and fails to effectively engage the audience, leaving much to be desired in terms of pacing and coherence. While the concept of Madame Web held promise, the execution falls short, leaving viewers longing for a more compelling and cohesive narrative. Overall, 'Madame Web' stands as one of the weakest entries in the Marvel universe, ranking alongside 'Morbius' as a disappointing miss rather than a hit."""
rwall-15147,8,Why the hate? (Except for No post credit scene),"Ok, I guess this movie is more of a 6 to 7, but some of these review ratings are too low so I gave it a one point offset... I love origin stories, this one could have been told a little better, but it was not bad. They really set this one up future sequels, although with all the negative reviews I hope it earned enough money for them to continue on with the story. This movie was way more enjoyable than ""The Marvels"". It will be interesting to see how the young girls get their powers. There are some great teen movies, like Harry Potter... but most of the time I find the teenagers in movies annoying as they over act, and they try to act like the adults. This kids in this one were not horrible. Again, there is a lot of story here left to tell, so let's hope they continue on."
eddietam,7,Smokey the Bear would be disappointed..,"At about 50 minutes into the movie, Cassandra Webb drives Julia, Anya, and Mattie to the woods to keep them safe after being chased by Ezekiel. Cassandra says to them: ""You are way safer out here. Just be like a girl scout girl.. 3 hours.. just stay here.. don't do anything dumb.. Seriously, don't do dumb things"" ..about 8 minutes later, the girls do the dumbest things a girl scout could do. They all left the woods to get something to eat with a raging campfire still lit as they all walked away.Smokey the Bear would say: Don't let forest fires be your fault. Make sure your fire is dead out. Remember, only you can prevent forest fires."
eed-61133,3,I was all in through most of the movie but the last half hour sucked monkeys... Soooooo bad so bad,"I usually have found that the Marvel movies that I enjoy are the ones that get the lowest ratings. I do not like superhero movies, but I do enjoy an expensive production.I was enjoying it and having fun watching most of the movie. It just felt like a fun idea with cute teenagers, decent back-stories and almost interesting personalities.... but then the last half hour was torture.... like they all gave up & clearly decided on the basic cut and paste... cuz it is actually garbage... plus really! Really bad dialogue. I don't mean just plain bad. I mean so bad that it sucked monkeys. I am glad I didn't pay for it. Even though i was 'giftedðŸ˜†' with a free watch at home, laying in bed, I wanted to walk out of the theater.They all should be so very embarrassed.Everyone makes mistakes and should be forgiven for it."
anahit1,3,disappointed.,"Personally, i am a huge Spider-man fan, a big marvel fan at that and this movie really disappointed me. The acting was horrible, and the storyline was all over the place, most of it wasnt even making sense to me, it felt like a fan made movie such as spider-man lotus. I was also disappointed by the fact that none of the girls (anya, julia, and mattie) actually got powers and it only seemed that way in the teasers, and i think because of that most of the fight scenes were bad. Hopefully Spider-man: beyond the spider-verse will make up for his horrible movie, honestly just save your time and money by not seeing this in theaters."
lilgilligan,1,Not even worth sticking on in the background smh,"'Madame Web' had the potential to weave a captivating narrative within the Spider-Man universe, but unfortunately, it missed the mark entirely, leaving me thoroughly unsatisfied.One of the most glaring issues with the film was its convoluted plot. Instead of delivering a coherent storyline, it felt like the writers threw together a mishmash of Spider-Man comic book elements without any regard for cohesion. Madame Web, a character ripe with complexity and intrigue, was reduced to a shallow portrayal that failed to engage or resonate with the audience.The pacing was another major letdown. Scenes dragged on endlessly, lacking any sense of urgency or purpose. It seemed as though the filmmakers were padding the runtime with unnecessary filler rather than focusing on meaningful character development or advancing the plot.Visually, the film fell flat. In an era where audiences have come to expect stunning CGI and immersive visual effects from superhero movies, 'Madame Web' failed to deliver. The action sequences lacked excitement and failed to capture the dynamic energy of Spider-Man's world.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of 'Madame Web' was its disregard for continuity within the Spider-Man universe. Characters behaved inconsistently, and key plot points contradicted established canon, leaving fans feeling confused and frustrated.Overall, 'Madame Web' failed to live up to its potential as a compelling addition to the Spider-Man franchise. With its disjointed plot, sluggish pacing, lackluster visuals, and disregard for continuity, it's a film that falls short on every front. Fans of the web-slinger would do well to steer clear and invest their time elsewhere."
pfsfghktf,4,Writers from the dollar store,"I ll just say that: These new Sony x Marvel movies like madame web , morbius etc keep the same writers that won't make the script better , and the directors are ""trapped"" and doomed in the making..It's like trying to grow goose eggs with chickens.. The movie shots and directing from S. J Clarkson are well executed ,the acting in my opinion was decent but not something surprising , but the scenario was so problematic yet sketchy that my interest was so low in the half quarter of the film. If you trying to make a modern superhero movie with a female protagonist you are taking risks that you can protect the with a strong script..I sound repetitive I know but it's so frustrating to wait for a movie like this and figuring out that mediocre script writers are involved again, so your expectations lay low.."
scottegbert,2,Madame Web is not a good movie (sorry not sorry),"I'm giving this a 2 because the musical score wasn't that bad. But there was a lot of questionable lines, questionable plot choices that really made me think. Dakota Johnson didn't do a great job tbh. To me, she sounded like she was being forced to say her lines against her will. The other actresses were nothing special either. In the trailers and tv spots, they kept showing them in their Spiderman outfits. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), they are only in them for two scenes.I really think the rights to Spider-Man (and all its side characters) should be bought back completely by Marvel Studios. Sony really doesn't seem to know what they want to accomplish with Spiderman."
elicopperman,3,Must Be Seen Just to be Believed,"As of this year, everyone's contender for the worst film released might go to Sony's disastrous Madame Web feature. Based on the Marvel character of the same name, the film is reported to be the fourth installment in Sony's infamous Spider-Man Universe. Unfortunately, this might be the only time we'll see said character on screen as the film is proving to be a critical and commercial failure, with many people deeming it to be one of the worst superhero movies to date. That being said, there's a good chance this film will have a chance of being looked back on for reasons completely different than intended.The film follows the titular Cassie Webb who ends up confronting her origins and past while trying to save three teenage girls from the future sensing villain Ezekiel Sims. Right from the get go, Madame Web's central problem is how poorly the filmmakers tried and failed to not only connect this should be stand alone feature into their own universe, but also bit off way more than they could chew storywise. The main storyline of Cassie rediscovering herself is too straightforward and perplexing for its own good, not helped by a stiltedly flat performance by Dakota Johnson, and having three different heroines come into play just makes things even more convoluted. It feels like Sony had no faith in this feature to stand on its own two feet and chose to squeeze in too many characters without fleshing any of them out at all. In addition, the dialogue is lousily written and does not sound like how anyone on planet Earth would communicate with one another. It's really telling how poorly written this movie is when even the leads don't sound like real humans one can relate to.On top of how poorly constructed the film's storyline is, many plot points that should have been explored either get ignored or get brought up out of nowhere. One could argue that certain plot beats were done as a means to hint at possible sequels, but when little explanation is given to Ezekiel Sims' own motives beyond being cartoonishly power hungry, then that's a sign that a lot more time was wasted than it should have been. Also, for a superhero movie, there's surprisingly a lot more talk than spectacle, as hardly any action comes afloat and any sequences that could be enticing are bafflingly edited and are hard to comprehend. It's to a point where sequences that are supposed to give off the feeling of intensity and suspense feel sloppy and pitiful rather than natural. Not to mention, so many character actions make little to no sense, and certain moments where Cassie and the girls try to protect themselves result in some of the stupidest coincidences you'll ever see in a superhero movie. It's sad how this movie is light on action and somehow lighter in brains.However, with all of those faults said, this movie is a surprisingly hysterical disasterpiece from near start to finish. While it isn't without its utterly boring eye-rolling moments, just watching the admittedly talented cast trying their darnedest to make their lines of dialogue sound convincing is just enough to snicker at profusely. The script is already laughably broken, and the direction from a first time feature film helmer coming into play just adds into the absurd incompetence displayed on screen. The visual effects feel so out of place and come out of left field so much that one would think they're tripping out instead of seeing a widely released movie from a major Hollywood studio. Lastly, the music score is as subtly interwoven into the feature as the constant barrage of product placement throughout the runtime, including one scene in the third act that had the guts to try and make Pepsi seem like a threat. As much as this film is painful to watch and hard to follow along, at least there is some ironic entertainment value from the baffling ineptitude shown in just under two hours.By coming off as more laughable and bizarre than enticing, Madame Web should be analyzed as a perfect example on how not to make a superhero film. The story is heinously convoluted, the characters are vastly underdeveloped, the acting is hopelessly wooden, and the other filmmaking qualities are utterly broken at the seams. Because of all that, this film has the chance of developing a cult following as a delightfully disastrous thrill fest, and there's a good chance people will get more value out of this for different reasons than the studio intended. I'm sure glad I got more out of it than I thought I would."
ryanmo-35178,7,Not too bad,"Heard a lot about how bad this movie is, especially this one is from Sony instead of Marvel. However, I do not this is that bad as the plot is complete and the actresses are acting good. The story is about madame web who has the ability to forsee the future, and she can change it! The boss is always dreaming 3 spider gals are trying to kill him and Dakota is trying to protect them. However, her ability is a little weak (she can replicate herself in the final fight). She needs to use her ability well to win. And she hates her mum much as she went to Amazon even in pregnancy, but it was only because she was only finding cures to save the baby. So it's not bad to watch this movie in my view..."
tofulight,1,What is that dub?,"I was 20ish minutes into this movie, confused by the fact that an English speaking cast with an English language script had worse dubbing than many MANY movies I've seen from non English language casts. I have no idea what the original dialog was bit I cannot imagine it was more wooden than what was in this film. The amout of times I was said ""why is this happening"", ""this doesn't track"" or "" that's not how people respond to this sort of thing"" had me wondering why I paid and money at all to watch this.I don't write reviews, I don't rate movies... I had to create an account just for this review and rate. If you're interested in this movie save your money until it's included with a streaming service you're subscribed to."
servalli1,8,Decent (dumb) entertainment. Ignore the lows from superhero-obsessed teens,"{Spoilers below are quite mild}
I have heard the movie got really low reviews, but decided to still give it a chance. I must say I don't generally care about superhero movies (Ok, The Boys are great, but that's a parody). And well, this movie turned out to be ... fine?While I cannot say it's an amazing, memorable or smart movie, it's not actually bad and it is fun. Still entertaining enough for you to want to know what happens next. This is a movie for normal people to distract for an hour and forget, not marvel geeks.People complaining there is not enough action, sorry, do you want a movie consisting of one big fight scene?It is decently paced so that you mostly think about the flaws after the movie is over.Superhero culture people are insufferable, this movie is just average, nothing out of the line. Why do people expect a superhero movie, which is almost by definition a silly concept, to be some kind of masterpiece?Things that are ok: pacing, acting, effects; paramedic setting, teens doing dumb stuff. Kinda nice and also funny how they show 2000s like history already.Also there seems to be some internal awareness of the stupidity of some decisions in the movie (forest bit anyone? Kinda ""I know it's not the best ideia but cannot come up with anything better"").In general, I like the idea of the protagonist powers and the point not being simply throwing each other around with CGI.What I didn't like:
a bunch of plot holes and threads left hanging probably due to being considered not entertaining, i.e. The main character's ease to get around while being searched for by the police. The legal situation is in general poorly handled, also with the parents bit. The police also not reacting to all the hell breaking loose, is that supposed to be that way? The protagonists never try to figure out how they end up being tracked (and, consequently, how to dodge it). There is more. The writing could really be improved.girls' superhero outfits. I don't care that's marvel, those costumes look silly in any movie that at least pretends to be serious. Looks cringey af. I like the protagonist design for not being shown wearing dumb costume like that.the antagonist that gets no backstory, we never discover what was his motivation to do what he did in the beginning of the story, also not fleshed out apart from one specific fear he shows prominently. He is also comically arrogant.Product placement is dumb and will always beThat last minute before credits, this scene also looks cringey.My rating would be something around 6.5, as in ""very average movie"", but I'm giving it an 8 to offset the histerically low reviews a bit."
TheReviewerBoyar,6,Don't be a sheep. It's a good movie,"There's a lot to talk about with this film; some people hate it and some people like it.Story: 7
It's very simple and runs through a 3-act structure. As you can imagine, it plays by the rules and gives a 1st act which establishes characters. In the 2nd act, we get conflict and in the 3rd act you have the cliche final boss ending. Nothing special in the story per-say, but it was serviceable and did its job. Of course, more could have been done but when Spider man 3 did a lot everyone hated it. But, when Madam web keeps it simple we want more action, more character development (i.e, spider women) and that's okay, but did the story we have here not entertain and achieve its albeit limited goals? It gave us an origin story so anyone who says the story is bad is a lier. It's at least serviceable or average.Cinematography: 8
I loved the shots; there was an absolute variety of shot sizes, angles, and movements here. You will appreciate how diverse the camera works and how complicated the shots are (e.g., diner scene). Sure, it zooms in but that's a style and I do respect a cameraman have style with a flair of creativity.Acting: 6
I feel like acting here is average and while the female leads do a great job the villain sounds so funny. It feels like the original actor's voice was bad so they got a guy to ADR over him... it's just weird and a sad thing that's happened here. But all the actors ultimately do their job and, other than the villain, I never got pulled out.Sound: 8
Sound is great here; as you would expect, everything has been functioning properly. Sound effects match and even music is awesome and enhanced the viewing experience.Action: 7
Sure, there isn't a whole lot of action here. We have an opening dream of action happening and that's awesome. But, we do get action scenes sprinkled throughout and I felt that was a smart thing to do. Have some character development, then action, and repeat: every action movie does this.Characterisation: 7
I think people need to be humble on this because it is an origin story for Madam web. Yes, all the characters like the spider women and the villain should've been written better with more character. But, it is about the protagonist over anything else. Imagine if people hate Jay Jon's Jameson because he doesn't have a ""background"" story. My point, side characters can be just that, just like how in Batman movies Rachel never had character development but bounces off other characters who will get it.Criticisms:
A lot of people simply hate this film because either it's female lead or because the trailer promised a really spider woman-packed film and didn't at all deliver in that respect. It's true, you barely see them as spider woman but the villain and Madam web was enough for me to be engaged.Other issues are the writing? Well that reflects things such as story and characterisation and to be honest.. story was better than character yes but character was average because Madam Web is the focus. They could've focused on all the characters, but the movie insists on focusing at Madam Web.Do the spiders look fake? Yes. Does Madam Web's costume look weird? Yes. Why didn't the protectors at the beginning grab the spider? See. Okay, so there are critical issues with the film but it was just a fun watch and that's all I wanted. We all wish this could be like Nolan's works but they're not; they're not Oppenheimer.A 6 seems fair as it brings together the people who like the movie and hate it. We can come together and say it was a good movie, not great."
craigzilla-89077,1,A Masterpiece... Of S*%#,"First and foremost this movie has one incredibly redeeming factor: Adam Scott and his G-Body (The Oldsmobile he drives in the film). I'd like to believe, in his backstory, he is rolling up to Texas 2k's with his straight sleeper, when he isn't saving lives of course. I assume since it takes place in the early '00's he probably had a 383ci small block with a healthy cam and maybe some light head work.But the real problem with the story is the thin character development, undeveloped backstory, and offensive costume designs. I think it's easy to blame the writers and director, but in reality they under pay the writers and fire them before they have time to qualify for healthcare. Then they, the executive producers/ creative producers, hand off a half baked script to a director and basically breathe down the director's neck because they love to micromanage. Plus you have studio executives putting in their random 2 cents about what they want to have in the movie whether it makes sense or not.All in all unless you're a fan of Adam Scott and clean G-Bodies you should pass."
tpsmith-85057,,This film has a new low in Hollywood film disasters.,"This movie was a Hollywood disaster. The characters, plot, visual effects, absolutely everything down to the last seconds of the film. The movie was dull and bland. This was blatantly setup to be forced into a sequel. Characters lacked dialog and communication, which really under developed the setting of the story. The constant foreshadowing made the movie have 0 suspence at all. The villian was underwhelming as well, one of the worst the Marvel-Sony verse has ever produced.Hollywood needs a new screen writing crew, the directors were poor when developing the scenes and sequence of events throught this film. This film had the potential to become something unimaginable, beyond the standards, yet, it hit the bare minimum.Nothing against the actors in this movie, the film crew, directors, or anything. This was just a poor put together film.Bad."
dylanmeggert,4,Better than the trailer made it seem,"The trailer for this movie gave me low expectations but I was still excited for the movie regardless. The casting was good and the characters of Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson), Julia Carpenter (Sydney Sweeney), Anya Corazon (Isabela Merced), and Mattie Franklin (Celeste O'Connor) were fun in a relatable way. Adam Scott playing Ben Parker was a fun easter egg, I like how he played the character. The only casting I couldn't agree with is Tahar Rahim playing Ezekiel, his tone didn't feel right for the dark character he was supposed to be. The costumes were amazing I wish they had more screen time, the spider-people suits only appeared on screen for probably about one minute worth of time spread out in different scenes. The final fight scene could have used a lot less shaking of the camera, that made it hard to focus on what was going on, the movement of the camera was far too dramatic. There's no post credit scenes, which I was kind of expecting there to be some sort of MCU tie-in scene, maybe with the time traveling-esque powers, a TVA post-credit scene would've been fitting, or even a Dr. Strange or Scarlet Witch easter egg too. Regardless of the lack of post credit scene's and MCU tie-ins, I like that it stands as it's own film because there's no indication if this film takes place as the same universe as the Venom movies."
e_s_reyne,4,Feminists are Angry About the Score,"Feminists are angry about the criticism of this film. The problem is not due to having four leading women. The problem is that the film just isn't good. How dense can you be anyway? Madam Web existed far before 2024 and nobody had a problem with the leading female character. So why are you so fragile that you think that's what is upsetting people here? In fact I'm upgrading the score to 4 stars, one for each leading woman, for a film that should be rated 1. The casting was fine, and the way they shot the clairvoyant sequences was really really cool. Seemed very well thought out and for most of them you'd have no idea she was actually seeing ahead and all the sudden she's back at the start without cheap cuts/jumps. I think it would have made a far better movie as a non-marvel movie, and would have preferred it as an action flick not having Spider(man/woman) ties holding it back."
jrhysnewton,1,Don't listen to critics. It's worse.,"I actually ignored all of the negative comments and reviews and was keen to see it anyway. I've liked a couple Marvel/ Sony projects that people didn't like... but oh my goodness. This was a trainwreck from beginning to end.Throughout all of the marketing and even in the movie were teased of this team of kick ass characters with powers. But it literally never happens. It seems more like a friendship story than a superhero story. Everyone is sitting waiting for this inevitable event. Doesn't happen.Even worse, major things that happen to MW seem like they were put in just because the writers forgot to add them and just threw it in...The writing was horrible and I'm sure it was a hard script to work. But some of the actors in this movie are already fairly subpar and the results showed.This I imagine will go down as one of the worst Sony movies of all time. I couldnt imagine the MW franchise surviving this one. Unfortunately already Meme fodder."
OmniusNemesis,2,2-Oct,"Puff. . . It is very strange indeed.It's not the fault of the actresses, it's the script, and the Trailer is a big rip off, everything they show there is just the interesting stuff. Too much comedy added { You can tell it's Marvel 2.0 }, and again I repeat, it's very strange.And also when something interesting happens it doesn't last at all.It seemed to be good with the trailer, but what a disappointment I have been and I had hopes that it would be something better, for the theme of the connection of the Spiders, but even with that it is not saved.It happens all too fast, even if they should improve the movie, it would need more length, and better explained.And not be so boring.I wouldn't even give it a 5/10.It's more like a 2/10."
nkkyym,1,Strongly worded email,"Whilst I enjoy the empowerment of women lol this goes to show us that a woman's place is clearly in the kitchen from the female writer to the so called female ""actresses""
From the clearly gender hating title of Madam to the our hatred towards the male lead who was just trying to do the world a favour and destroy these terrible excuses of humans,
As an acting nonbinary male unicorn I find the plot, acting, storytelling downright disgusting and I'm personally suing Dakota Johnson for ruining my Friday night off work at the stripclub.Stay in your own lane from now on!!#getbackinthekitchen #knowyourroll #MYCHOICE."
calahao,6,Clunky but fine,"Madame Web is an interesting attempt to give an obscure Marvel character the spotlight. She is usually relegated to the role as a supporting character, and so the efforts to make her a protagonist are interesting. She's flawed, she's intelligent, making for an unconventional action protagonist that relies on her mind over raw power.Where the movie fails is mostly in regards to its exposition, with unnatural conversations early on. Some shots are also jittery, this experimention clearly not paying off. Still, the story and the characters by themselves hold the movie up.Overall, a recommendation, especially if you're a Marvel fan."
bitnicat,3,One Big Disappointment,"A movie that includes 4 superheroines and 1 super villain and throughout the entire movie there are almost no scenes of any of them as a superheroine. The only one who is still somehow presented as a superheroine is Dakota Johnson, and only at the end of the movie, and even that is lame.So for everyone who expects to see a lot of scenes of superheroines fighting a super villain, I can spare you the expectation and say in advance that except maybe in one of the visions you won't see any, because maybe the filmmakers are planning a sequel.Also, the plot itself is messy and in the sections of the visions most viewers will not understand at all what it is about, Because they will see sections of the film that repeat themselves without any logic, As well as the how heroine is dealings with them.The only thing I liked about this overly long movie is the music and soundtrack which includes some really good songs.Maybe if they shortened the length of the movie significantly and removed all the banal and unnecessary sections from it, it could perhaps be a pilot for a TV Series.In short, One big disappointment from a superhero movie that I had high expectations from it."
christian74-32275,6,"I don't get the hate, its not amazing, but it's certainly not a 3 either","Seeing the 3.7 rating I was a bit dubious going into this, but was pleasantly surprised.I'd give it a solid 5 to 5 & a half. Worth a look if you're into super hero stuff, specifically when characters realise they have powers etc...Look, it's not going to win any Oscars obviously but giving this a 1 is ridiculous, I've seen far worse. The action, effects & production values are all good & it's got heart.And I'm not sure what all the fuss is about re' the script. It wasn't majorly groundbreaking or original or anything, but the story ark was fine & everything made sense.It's obvious that this project could have been executed a bit better & if you are a fan of the comic or a marvel fan that had been eagerly anticipating its release, then I guess you might be a bit disappointed. It's obviously those people that have scored this a 1/2 due to anger & disappointment rather than objectively rating this.Anyway as long as you don't go into it expecting anything too amazing I'm sure you'll enjoy, the action, the effects & the heart."
abirzenith,2,A new classic 'So bad its good' movie is born!,"I think this is the highest production quality for a bad , troll style movie we have ever had. This will be THE ROOM in the future, people will go in waves into the future just to have a laugh and have a fun time.Everything about this movie is so bad that its good, the dialogues, the script, the ridicules CGI and plot hole barrage that puts some of the worst movies out there to shame.Except its wrapped in my more expensive packaging and has a media market behind it, which actually makes things even funnier in hindsight.Easily the best bad movie we have had in a while, specially compared to expectations vs. Reality."
shanecostantini,1,How is this even possible,"Who gets the writers of Morbious one of the biggest flops and worst written movies of all time to make a movie on a character that noone cares about? This movie won't even make $100m at the box office world wide. It was so badly written my 7yr old thought kids wrote it. The acting was unbearable. A blind deaf mute could edit better than these editors. I just don't understand how anyone could watch this go yeah we did good lets release this we are on a clear winner. Stop pushing agendas and just go back to good story telling. Aliens, Hunger Games, Tomb Raider all great stories with female leads. Difference is there is no agenda. Just awesome stories and great acting that makes them timeless. At this rate Hollywood is dead."
cdjh-81125,3,An Abject Disaster In Every Sense,"I've heard many people say that Madame Web makes Morbius look like The Dark Knight but I'd say it makes it look like Batman Forever, Maybe? Because this film doesn't really work on any level and the only reason I didn't want to claw my eyes out from boredom was that I was constantly fascinated to see what basic filmmaking and storytelling techniques it was going to fail to execute next. It was like watching a car crash in real time and I couldn't take my eyes of it for all the wrong reasons.Credit where credits due, there is actually some actual ingenuity behind the camera here but almost every scene feels like it's shot by a different director. At its best it's inconsistent but at its worst it's totally incomprehensible both tonally and visually. I liked this central trio quite a bit but the character's outside of them fell totally flat, to put it mildly. Dakota Johnson gives a boring performance for an even more boring character. Her power are poorly executed with some pretty nauseating editing and her connection to other characters from the Spider Man universe feels like a needle drop for no one.I actually feel quite bad for Tahar Rahim here because this has got to be one of the worst villains I've seen in a movie, maybe ever, and that character is essentially the personification of everything that's wrong with this movie. His backstory and motivations make no sense, everything he does is horribly executed because of the atrocious CGI and almost every line of his sounds like it's been overdubbed and it's as distracting as it sounds. Every scene in this movie is either over too quickly or dragged out way too long. I think for the first half I couldn't help but be amazed at the disaster that was unfolding in front of me but by the time the second half came around I was just bored and I wanted it to be over.I don't even know if I can truly blame the actual filmmakers of this movie because this entire thing just reeks of something that was torn apart in the editing room by studio execs. The problem is that I doubt it was a very good movie to begin with. I don't know who Madame Web is for but more importantly I don't know why it exists beyond the most cynical of corporate greed. I actually did kind of enjoy watching this movie to a degree but in the same way I enjoyed watching The Room or Cats. This entire film feels like the embodiment of all the worst aspects of the current superhero movie climate. I'm never happy to see movies fail but I need the incoming flop of Madame Web to be a sign that things have to change for this genre to thrive again."
danny3750,1,Please avoid this movie,Promised my kid I would take them to see this movie. Despite the really bad reviews.Do yourself & your family a huge favour & avoid this movie. I genuinely don't know what the studio has tried to put together but I can't believe this is the best version of this movie.The way some of the actors speak their lines is painful! Like they are reading it off a prompt board ( they probably are). The movie jumps from one scene to another? Lots of dead space in this movie where scenes are just kept for far too long.This movie is like a comedy sketch show is trying to imitate this movie & this is the comedy version (Saturday night live).Sony have done a stupid cash grab & just messed this movie up from every angle.I hope this movie looses money & they learn to stop putting out utter rubbish.Please avoid this movie. I feel I have to give something to a local charity to try to put right the fact I spent money on going to see this movie.YES it's that bad.BAD SONY.
mindlessmoviemaster,1,Nepo Spider.,I went to walk in the theater to watch this and I saw a big fat bald guy in there with glasses and he scared me so I left then came back for the next showing. Anyway I watched the last showing tonight let's just say it had me dozing off like I had taken a hand full of melatonins. Anyways I was like why can't they just start where she is already old and stuff that's the Madam Web we like anyways She is am-bu-Lance driver almost hits her other chick and her mom was all in the jungle 9 months pregnant and is like I'm out here sweating milk yo now I got to get bit by this radioactive spider!!! Anyways this movie was bad. It's nooo Morbin Time! That's for sure!
ad-rak,7,Underrated Pastime,"I'm not entirely sure why this film received so many negative reviews. But I feel like it's less about the film itself and more about one of those cancellations that are so popular in America right now. For my part, I would definitely recommend this film as evening entertainment for the whole family. I particularly enjoyed Dakota Johnson's performance. Yes, it's true, the film has its logical flaws, but I don't think my evening entertainment needs to meet the standards of a doctoral thesis. The special effects/CGI are modern and appropriate. The story isn't too shallow. I've seen many worse movies with higher ratings. I would happily watch a sequel with my children."
lounisphography,4,The whole movie was the beginning.,"The movies never really started. Badly written.The movie was okay up until the train scene. Then it just stopped. Nothing was happening, they talked a lot about what will happen in the future but nothing happened in the present.The cinematography and actors were okay. But it must be hard to make a movie when nothing is happening. There is a subplot of Emma Robert having being pregnant and having a baby. It brings nothing to the story at all. Not sure why it was there to beginning with.The vilain had all his dialogues added on post production, perhaps to work on his accent (he's originally French)Not worth to pay for this, just wait for it to come on streaming platform."
punimitsu,7,Pretty good movie - what's with the hate?,"Getting pretty tired of the endless criticism of any action movie that dares *shock horror* to have female leads.There's absolutely nothing about this movie to warrant a one star review. Reviewers giving it 1 and 2 stars need to take a moment for self reflection. I mean, are you ok?The writing's about the same as other Marvel
movies... better than the Spider-Mans I'd say (bar Into the Spiderverse which is genius!)Dakota Johnson is actually great - way better than many other Marvel actors. And the 3 girls are fab 👌🏼Not as much gratuitous 'action' and exploding as recent Marvel fare, which is a welcome relief... overall, I thought it was a fun movie with a decent plot and a great cast. Watch it and see for yourself!"
syd9907,1,Why? This Film is SO Bad...,"Madame Web is do bad, where does one begin? First and foremost, Dakota Johnson is just not a good actress. Let's get real, she's gotten to where she is because of her Nepo baby status. The success of those dreadful Fifty Shades of Grey films had very little to do with with Johnson or her acting, it was because the books were fan favorites (the last film was the lowest grossing in the trilogy). Also, whoever wrote the script for Madame Web should never write another script again. The dialogue was trite, the storyline was boring and it was directed and shot like it was amateur hour on an abandoned studio backlot. The overall feeling of Madame Web felt super-low budget. I've seen student films that were way better than this nonsense. I don't always agree with critics, but on this disaster of a film, they are spot-on. Madame Web has no redeeming qualities at all. If your curiosity gets the better of you, just wait until it's on a streamer, but by no means spend your hard-earned money on it. Technically Madame Web is part of the larger Spider-Man cinematic multiverse, so how on earth did they get this film so wrong with an $80 million budget??"
jeff-84501,1,Horrendous movie,"I have no idea what the directors were on for this film. A j*nkie from Vegas could probably have put together a better movie on the same budget. Filled with a bunch of cringy moments and a story that made no sense to me. There wasn't a single moment in the entire 2 hours where I was on the edge of my seat of felt some kind of joy or emotion at all. For me it was thin, emotionless and over all just a bad movie. If you're considering going to the cinema and watch this I would highly suggest that you don't. You're way way better off spending your money elsewhere, neither is it worth any of your time."
datoneman,1,It was very unique to be nice about it,"It was very horribly women driven to the point it was nauseating the writers f up this movie the actors was great but it's hard to act clearly with a bad script because it was awful to me as far as writing then the execution was awful like seriously your only showing them a deja Vu dream sequences having their powers and not actually having their powers to fight the bad guy was awful writing, I can see the brainstorming room like yeah this will blow them a way,smh just stupid writing I feel so bad for the actors frfr because it had great potential frfr but the writing was so badddddd omg I hope they give the Spider-Man franchise to marvel fast."
bigv-18362,1,What did I just watch,This by far had to be the biggest waste of time I have ever spent watching a movie. It was beyond useless from start to finish at no point. Was there anything good. How do you make a superhero movie and have literally no superheroes except some lady that can see fragments of the future. Just stupid. Even if they make a sequel to this train wreck dumpster fire of a movie I wouldn't bother watching it. The three girls complete and utter brats liked nothing about them. I don't normally leave reviews but I have to tell you. Please do not waste your time watching this horrible travesty of a movie. Don't do it.
fsogfan,3,"Flat, Boring and missed Comedic moments","Wanted to like this film but at the end, it felt really boring and flat. Then I read about the extensive rewrites, so no wonder the film is a dud.It opens with the back story of Madame Web's mother who is pregnant in the Amazon, how she dies and was bitten by a rare spider with healing and supernatural powers. Then we move forward to a grown up Cassandra Webb in 2003 who is an EMT in NYC. As the story evolves, we learn about her EMT partner (Ben Parker) whose family will eventually produce the future Spiderman (Peter Parker). The original script had Cassandra involved in saving the unborn Spiderman from the nemesis who killed her mother. These rewrites explain why they built up the cast in the firehouse in the beginning but don't use them throughout the film.Then 3 teens are added who need Cassandra's protection as her clairvoyant powers emerge and the talent of these young actors are wasted. The script is schizophrenic. It morphs from a superhero film to a horror flick during future flashes.Instead of the wit & humor found in beloved superhero films, the writers give us a passenger who keeps asking Cassandra if he's on the right train. So many missed opportunities. While the 3 teens have sassy personalities, they're mostly used as midriff eye candy in the film. And when Dakota Johnson tries to climb her closet wall like a spider, this could have resulted in a good comedic pratfall but was missed.Future flashes are handled clumsily. In the writer's desperate attempt to introduce futuristic tech, they have the nemesis acquire new facial recognition & aging software, access to city wide CCTV, control traffic lights and advance cell and Bluetooth technology.Despite the writers' attempt to cobble together a script, there should have been more smart action and dialogue like in the ambulance scene towards the end where they throw off the nemesis using a charged defibrillator."
houseib,2,What the hell Marvel !!!,"I am a big fan of marvel movies, but this one.. suddenly i saw the spoder-man meme getting life.Why you made this, not action, not comedy, not fantasy, not fun...
Plot doesnt make much sense, those marvel heroes powers we so much love are reduced to some kind of dejavu glitches... and some kind of hanycap spider-man from the 80´s.Three supposed heroes that doesnt appear in this movie and i guess wont appear never more cause im not wasting more time watching the sequel.This movie for me in the beginning was building up nicelly but then.. it all became a BSOD.When the web lady travels to Peru, with that hitech survillance system and she didnt get captured.. guess it was updating the system at that time."
akoaytao1234,6,Ma-dumb Web of Comedy,"It primarily tells the story of a paramedic who suddenly sees the future after a near death experience. When a 'spider' man tries to stop his prophetic death, she has to use her new found powers to save to change the future AND also solve the long mystery of her mother's death in Peru.I'll just say that this is one of the worst script from a movie I had watched. The Peru scenes are probably one of the dumbest (and funniest) backstory/explanation in history. It expects you to be shocked but the way they presented it is so questionable it hurts. The 'oracle' plot of the film is so on the nose, it really was laughably absurd at times that the only other person from my showing had to leave. AND their is a key plot point THAT never was able to handle airports, really MOVIE.Dakota Johnson cannot carry face acting that this ""superhero"" role requires. She just is so plain and uninspired. I do not think that she can's act (see Lost Daughter or Cha Cha Real Smooth), but the ridiculousness is just too much for her too handle. Her line reading is so dour and straight, it reads so awfully and funnily (regardless of seriousness) on-screen. She tries to act normally that her scene does not translate the 'hero' scenario.I do want to give some love to Celeste O'Connor who did the most for her bratty rich kid role. She's my solo bright spot for the film.5/5 Cinematic Mess. Must laugh in the cinema."
dannyklee2,1,Paramedic? These are NOT.,"Please know that the EMS portrayed in this film is doing EVERYTHING WRONG. I mean EVERYTHING is wrong, I have not seen such a SHAME of EMS in any other movie.. well, dick wolf's chicago show was pretty darn bad but this is FAR WORSE.I cannot believe with a rather substantial budget they did not even put a little bit of effort into the EMS Scenes.The uniform is not correct, the methods are not correct, the reasons behind what they were doing was not correct, the way the actors behaved, EMS would Never do.I know this is a FAKE movie, there are also no such things as jungle spiders, but when portraying regular life, there is a responsibility to portray it correctly or else the filmmakers would just lose all credibility."
DarkVulcan29,8,"By no means perfect, but still not quite the dumpster fire has critics say.","Has the movie goes on, it's pretty easy to see that this is a prequel to the Tom Holland Spider-Man films.Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, very well, someone who just lives for her job as a paramedic and nothing else. But soon discovers that she has a great calling, being so reluctant, she realizes she can't run from her destiny.Dakota Johnson is great, but she plays off the other girls quite well, who also have a great destiny ahead of them. The movie is slow into getting to the point. And at first these characters annoyed me, but it gets better when they come together has a team. Also the main bad guy is good, he is an evil Spider Man. Action scenes are alright not great on other Marvel film level. All in all I found this movie entertaining."
benoitjeanliboiron,7,Don't listen to others ! It is not that bad.,"This Sony movie is not that bad as people are saying ! They are just haters who think that each superhero movie need to be as good as Avengers Endgame...When I saw on the internet that this movie was even less good that Morbius, I was not expecting anything. In fact, I was suprised because Ive prefered Madame Web than Morbius even if some are saying the opposite.It is true that this is not the best superhero movies because you don't have the thrills and the excitement of movie like Endgame or Spiderman Homecoming by example.I passed a good time and me and my friends even laugh hard at some acts. The actresses were good in general and they have done their best.For me, it was more a psycology thriller than a common superhero movie, but it was not that bad. The humor was more for young people than older, but by sometimes, it was funny.At the end, I was down to see what comes next with those characters."

Absolutely horrific trash. If any movie doesn't deserve a sequel it's this one. Please let sink back into the cesspit it came from, forever to be forgotten. Do literally anything else with your time and money rather than watch this junk. Writing terrible, story line terrible, directing terrible. Just utter trash start to finish. I'd give it zero if I could. Perhaps this brings to a close the superhero movie age and is the beginning of us needing something better, but as far as superhero movies go this is by far the worst I think I've seen. I really didn't expect it to be this awful. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
jasonrothery,1,Truly terrible in almost every conceivable way,"This is one of those movies where it's incomprehensible that it even made it into theatres. Everything about this abomination is insultingly amateurish, from the bizarre and nonsensical script, to the flat, horrendous acting, to the stiff and awkward directing. Sony must love burning money, because they're about to lose tends of millions of dollars on this flaming pile of trash. I was hoping against hope that it would be enjoyably bad, but the reaction it provoked was boredom and confusion. No character does anything because it makes sense, but simply to move the ""plot"" -- and I'm using that word very, very loosely -- forward. Two hours of yawning and head-scratching means I'm two hours closer to death, and all the worse off for it."
yqygnypsq,1,Bad movie,"""Madam Web"" is a film that falls short of expectations, delivering a lackluster and sleep-inducing experience. With a poorly executed storyline, it fails to captivate audiences from start to finish.The screenplay feels hastily put together, lacking depth and coherence. Character development is virtually nonexistent, leaving viewers disconnected from the protagonists' struggles and motivations. As a result, it's challenging to invest emotionally in the narrative, leading to a disengaged viewing experience.One of the major drawbacks of ""Madam Web"" is its pacing. The film moves at a sluggish pace, with scenes dragging on without purpose or intrigue. This sluggishness contributes to the overall sense of boredom and apathy that permeates the viewing experience.Despite attempts to inject excitement with action sequences, they feel forced and formulaic, failing to provide any genuine thrills or suspense. Even the most visually stunning moments are unable to compensate for the lack of substance in the storytelling.In addition to its narrative shortcomings, ""Madam Web"" suffers from uninspired direction and lackluster performances. The cast struggles to breathe life into their characters, delivering wooden and unconvincing portrayals that further detract from the film's appeal.Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a forgettable cinematic endeavor that fails to leave a lasting impression. With its lack of originality, poor execution, and tedious pacing, it's a film best avoided by discerning viewers seeking a compelling and engaging cinematic experience."
javiersegurasr,1,Movies that are created using Fiverr contractors...,"Are better than this. This movie feels like too much energy was placed on not doing things that superhero movie fans might like. The entire time, I'm thinking, ""Are you trying to recreate what a superhero movie is supposed to be?"". I was imagining that this movie was a superhero movie that an author like Nora Roberts might make, or Danielle Steele-it was just so off-beat from what true fans want; it had to have been made for a different audience. It's like going to a burger joint that only sells tofu. Sony, please, for the love of God, just stop it. Leave the superhero movies to the studio that actually appreciates what it means to be a comic fan."
roytoyimdb,3,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"I was trying to keep an open mind when watching this movie. I'm a die-hard fan boy of comic book genre movies and have watched pretty much anything related to Marvel/DC etc.I've seen a lot of bad movies in my time, Daredevil, Green Lantern and even the bad ones have something fun about them.But wow Madame Webb is a really really bad movie, like so bad that I feel sorry for everyone associated with this movie.I swear the script must have been by ChatGPT. The whole thing felt like a low budget movie done by first year film students.There's no redeeming qualities to this movie at all. Only deep sadness about what has become of the genre. Can Disney please buy Sony?"
donovanckent,7,Why all the negativity? The movie really wasn't that bad,"I don't know why everyone keeps hating on this movie. It really wasn't that bad. They stayed true to the original comics (mostly), the acting was good, production value was good and the movie wasn't all about being a ""Girl Boss"".My only gripe is with the tracking system that Ezekiel used. This story takes place before Spiderman was born in the 20th Century (according to the Sony Spiderman Universe) and advanced technology like that hadn't been invented yet. However, I do feel like the writers made it work in the movie.I do feel like people might be judging this movie unfairly, and that is probably as a result of all the M. C. U disasters that have been released recently which have caused people to become jaded and making up their minds before they even watched the movie."
craving_for_good_content,1,Suddenly DCEU looks good,"Oh, where do I begin with this cinematic 'masterpiece'? If laughter is the best medicine, then this movie could replace health insurance. With ratings soaring to the dizzying heights of above 3, one must wonder if the reviewers were watching the same movie or just enjoying the popcorn a bit too much.The writers, bless their hearts, should be nominated for 'Best Fantasy' at the next awards show for making us believe this movie had a plot. The writers owe us a sincere apology.And the plot holes! They were so big, you could use them as portals to a better movie. The story was like a connect-the-dots puzzle, except all the dots were in different movies.In conclusion, this movie is a must-watch if you enjoy questioning your life choices for 90 minutes straight. One star may seem generous, but let's face it, it's for the effort."
zaakir_o,10,Nostalgically bad,"I only gave it a 10 to try to impact the overall rating. It was definitely a 6.There's enough critics to tell you why it's bad. However, for someone who grew up in the early 2000s and was obsessed with Raimi's Spider-Man this movie felt almost nostalgic. It had potential, but where it lacked in most places was made up for by seeing characters in cool spidey outfits and Johnson's comedic timing. The cinematography is weird, but not bad or difficult to understand. 7 year old me would have loved this movie because it has everything I would have wanted, right down to the song choices.If you're someone who appreciated bad female-lead superhero movies like Halle Berry's Catwoman or Jennifer Garner's Electra then this is for you."
sirgarrykay,7,Not as bad as the reviews are saying,The movie is good. It's not omg amazing but it's nothing near morbius or the Fantastic Four reboot from the 2010s. It's an origin story and like many origin story movies you kind of want more but it does make you want to see a sequel. There's plenty of action and it is engaging throughout. And Dakota tells the story well.The movie is set in the 2000's and the movie kind of reflects that also? But I like that it's not heavily CGI like Avengers or something. There's plenty of practical sets and effects which I enjoyed.The main issue is the villain. He was dubbed over almost the entire movie? What was up with that? Kind of distracting but not a deal breaker. Also the beginning of the movie had choppy edits and fast camera movements that was annoying but thankfully it stopped after like 10-15 minutes.I hope it makes money and a sequel is made. I'd be excited to see the cast come back in full force.Also people being annoyed she doesn't use her powers a ton is like?? She just got them and is trying to figure out how they work. I hate when movies make it where all of a sudden the hero is an expert with their powers lol. This movie is realistic.
darkstarsphoto,2,Shakes head and stares blankly at the screen....,"First I want to start off with saying the concept was cool and the extremely brief scenes of them in the classic costumes was pretty sweet but omg this movie was sooo bad. Predictable and typical all the way down to expression and dialog. The script writing was horrible, some B movies have a better script and execution. The visual effects were terrible even though its a newer movie it matched the visuals of some of the worst marvel movie visuals that are older. Some scenes could have been great but they were ruined with quick cuts, non consistant cinematography and again horrible acting. I wish they did something better with this. Such a missed opportunity, glad I didn't pay to watch it. If they ever go forward with another they need a director that puts heart and soul into , not just a cliché project, cliché everything. Now I'm going to go back to shaking my head and staring at the wall to digest what just happened and what could have been....sigh...."
sparkling711-886-757860,2,"Stop filming napo baby, it's awfull","Brrrr. Horribly filmed, terribly acted. Who told Dakota she was an actress? We all know that charisma can save a movie. Can make viewing bearable. But if you film actors whose only advantage is their relatives, then all your mistakes and absurdities will be emphasized.Is it really easier to film this tree than to find an aspiring actress with talent?Yes, yes, there are exceptions. Eat. But not in this case. Maybe the studio should have hired for her a stunt double for all the emotional scenes? For active scenes? For scenes with text? Stop, stop, stop. What then remains? 😁 Ooh, the name in the credits would be enough."
numan_k96,1,"Waste of time, tacky plot","This cinematic endeavor is not only disappointing but also a complete waste of time. With a bland plot, poor execution, and an uninspired fantasy style, it fails to captivate audiences. From start to finish, it's an exercise in tedium, leaving viewers yearning for more substance and creativity. Skip this one and save yourself the agony of sitting through a dull and forgettable experience. Uninspired and lacking imagination, this fantasy flick falls flat with a tedious plot and lackluster storytelling. The attempt at world-building feels forced, leaving viewers disconnected and disinterested. Despite potential, it fails to deliver any excitement or engagement, making it a forgettable watch."
HasankaDesigner,1,"""Hope the spiders were worth it, Mom"". No, it wasn't, and neither is this film.","I always disregard critics' opinions about a film and approach it with an open mind. However, 'Madame Web' is a prime example of how studios consistently butcher beloved characters. Companies like Sony and Warner Brothers should take a step back and reconsider their approach. They ought to delve into the original source material and hire individuals who are passionate about storytelling, rather than churning out senseless films.Where do I begin with this movie? There are no redeeming qualities. The acting is subpar, the pacing is reminiscent of disasters like 'Catwoman,' and the storyline lacks substance.One commendable aspect is their attempt to introduce a fresh perspective to the superhero genre. Instead of the typical world-saving scenario, 'Madame Web' focuses on rescuing potential heroes. However, this concept is executed poorly and is painfully predictable.I sincerely hope Sony reflects on this failure and realizes that their ideas are flawed. Just because they operate a media conglomerate doesn't guarantee they understand audience preferences.Madame Web is a fantastic character, both in comics and in 'Spiderman: The Animated Series.' I eagerly anticipate a future portrayal of the character in films, hopefully by a studio other than Sony."
hashimrazzza,1,Worst Story Ever!,"If I could give this movie zero stars I WOULD! Can someone make a petition for Sony to stop producing any other character movies besides Spider-Man? I mean come on.. I thought Morbius was trash and set the bar pretty low but it's clear as day that Madame Web has officially set the bar IN HELL! Also, amazing job releasing this movie on Valentine's Day! That was complete sarcasm btw because my boyfriend fell asleep 4 times during this movie and I mentally checked out about 10 times as well.On a better note - the actresses did an amazing job it just sucks that their talents were wasted on such a low quality movie like this.Seriously though, don't waste your money. You're better off waiting for it to release on a streaming platform. At least then it will be free and you can take some Tylenol in the comfort of your home for the headaches that this movie will make you have."
rotten-potatoes,4,Charlie's web Angels,"When the young women left the forest and some pop song came on, I almost lost it. I am so jealous of the person who was allowed to write/direct this film. He or she has to be a tad under qualified.The movie started off lame, like ""Congo"" lame. Got a tad better when Dakota was first introduced. Got lame again when the bad dude/spider guy was introduced. Got little better when the Charlie's web angels were introduced. Got real lame when the Charlie web angels were dancing to Brittany spears, which was by far the worst scene in the movie.I loved madame webs abilities. That part of the movie was probably better than ""next"" with Cage. But unfortunately the movie had to fill in the other hour plus of content, and that's where it fails. So only madames abilities and Dakota Johnson acting were the only redeeming aspects of the film.That AED scene, better yet any reference to EMS in the movie was LAME. But most people wouldn't notice that so movie gets pass.Overall I enjoyed it. Probably wouldn't watch again. But it's worth a watch. And thank god ppl hate it because I would have definitely tortured myself to the sequel Charlie web angels deux."
arthimea,6,not bad when considering one thing,"If this were not a superhero movie, meaning no dumb costumes and less dumb explanations, with very few changes this could have been a blockbuster. This shows how overrated the superhero movies are....
Dakota Johnson did a good job and the story was not too bad overall if it were not for some poor choices such as naming the spider tribe spiders in spanish, the cartoony costumes that did not match the rather mondane atmosphere of the movie, and some clumsy action scenes. Wall crawling should have been implemented more like in an horror movie int the way possesed people crawl walls and less like spiderman....bottom line ...not great, but less dumb than latest superhero movies."
chand-suhas,2,What an unfunny joke for a film!,"Madame Web explores the spider-world, where a particular unidentified species of spider has incredible healing powers and also provides superhuman abilities. One of the main researcher is Constance Webb who discovers the spider but her greedy colleague Ezekiel has a different agenda. 30 years later, Constance's daughter Cassie is a paramedic and a near death experience gives her the power to see future. The future she saw, puts her on an unplanned mission to save three teens from a killer whom they call as ""Ceiling Man"", who is none other than Ezekeil. How does Cassie save the three girls and also uncover what happened to her mother 30 years ago, while figuring out how to control her powers forms rest of the story.Madame Web definitely is among the worst superhero films and it comes down to how bad the writing is, both screenplay and dialogue wise. Even the actors look out of place and less committed. With nobody putting in enough effort to sell what is on the screen, Madame Web ends up as a tedious watch with nothing worthy to remember. The dialogues are so bad, even the dramatic ones end up sounding funny. Spider-Man is a beloved character and when making a spin-off where you keep enough references to Spider-Man's world, one ought to be careful with their narrative. Sadly, Madame Web has bad vfx as well and action scenes fall flat too."
garyhope-16182,8,Don't get the hate for this movie,"I've been to see this today with my friend, we both throughly enjoyed it! It's crazy to me at how horrible people are being about it! Dakota wasn't the actress I thought that would work but she was really good in it! I liked that it was story based movie over mindless action all the way through! Everytime it's a woman lead movie the reviews are almost always so negative! Please give it a chance as these reviews are not in my honest opinion being very fair on it at all! People seem to complain for the fun of it these days and refuse to just sit back and enjoy!! I hope it's starts getting the praise it deserves!!"
TheWorldmaker,6,"Acceptable, not as bad as they're telling you.","Let's be clear. This is NOT as bad as many of the reviews have been saying and scoring online. Hence my own score to help redress the balance.Yes, it is a generic origin story and yes, as with almost all Marvel stories, she/they are orphans or almost, and mostly rich with it too; but this should not take too much away from an alternative approach to the spider-bitten heroes, or in this case heroines.In this case the principle heroine is the rise of Madam Web in her destined role to protect and nurture her three little weblets, her spider chicks, with whom, with great responsibility, will come great power, and all that. So what more can you ask for while Miles Morales and the Peter Parkers are busy biting off more than they can chew, I mean Gwen Stacey can't be everywhere on behalf of girl spider-power?Like most of these origin stories there's a lot of potential to go in a more dramatic direction to pull out all the emotions and drama of discovery and mastery, of coming-together and finding their destiny; but like all things there is never enough time, or writing skill, to bring everything out and explore the identities and subtleties of every character, so we have a rush through the story, a shorthand for what could have been.There are one or two key issues, that generic style of story spoilt by some very poor action camera work, a very unsteady-cam with jump-cuts that left my head spinning at the fast-ambulance chase sequences, but once you get through those issues and the camera settles down it's just a story of a woman discovering her inner power.So, spider-girl power, times four, confronting one murderer with his own powers and finding their future roles in fighting for justice, and all that. Nothing classic but probably worth your time for a little Spidy-escape."
khanarhumqayyum,1,how did marvel fell so low.,"Please stop marvels. First it was the Marvels and i thought what a mess, it could'nt get any worse but it got 10X worse with this movie. 30 mins in and i already regretted watching this freak show. The acting was way off, the action was so off that i dont have words for it. The direction of the movie......half way through and i dont even know what they are trying to do or what direction the story is taking. The cast is sooooo unlikeable, idek how i was able to watch the whole movie and wasted 2 hours of life on this. These past few projects of marvels were akhhhh. Im not gonna waste my money on any of marvels movies now, i'd rather prefer to download it for free from somewhere."
bpack66,2,Rather watch paint dry...,"When I heard that Dakota Johnson would be starring in this, I knew right away that it would be utter trash. I've seen belly button lint with more acting skills than she's got. The only reason she made it into the Hollywood clique is because of her parents. Pure nepotism. She's terrible as an actress. It had a lot going for it, but I just can't get past the actress. Maybe if they made Superhero movies that isn't so female heavy and threw a few male actors in there. Even Black Widow had David Harbor in it that livened it up a lot. This movie just had one actor that was her co worker, but he had very little screen time where as the other three women made up the complete cast for this one. Add a little variety please. The screenplay for this is also terrible. The lines ...coupled with the acting, just shreds this movie to pieces."
Thetriminator,4,Could have been so much better,"Ok where to start? Is it a good movie, sadly no. It's ok but it could have been so much better. It was never going to be an amazing movie because the lead character doesn't have the clout to be a main character let alone hold an entire movie up on their origin story. At best Madame Web would have been done better justice had she been included in other Spider-Man films as a side story.As far as the 3 other girls you see in the trailer I'll spoil it right now, what you see in the trailer is pretty much all you see in the entire movie (basically 2 flash forwards and brief ones at that) so if you're sitting there hoping to see some action you'll be waiting a long time. As far as the bad guy goes I've got to be frank but the writing for this guy is plain dumb and it makes him flat, one dimensional and utterly unconvincing as all he does is follow one path constantly and it just gets boring. His costume is ok, you can see where they went with the design (as this is pre Peter Parker), so they made it look kind of like the Tobey Maguire suit so it looked ok. You don't get to see Mme Web in suit until the end and it's not a bad design but the glasses she wears look like some cheap Oakley cast offs and frankly you can just tell they'd run out of budget. Sadly the suits the 3 girls wear all looked great so it's a shame we didn't get to see more of them in action.Madame Webb's powers become repetitive and annoying after a very short while and the whole script reeks of utter predictability from pretty much the opening scene. You just know what's going to happen (in one scene she has to go to Peru but having made it clear she rarely goes anywhere you ask yourself how she got a passport so quickly) ,but when she does get to Peru it takes here mere hours to discover the place her mother was murdered and the tribe that saved Cassandra's life and figure out how to use this magical ability she's seemingly had zero control of throughout the entire movie. Couple all this with some very sketchy re-dubbing of lines that little or no effort was put into actually hiding and you've got a movie that could have and frankly should have, been a welcome addition to the Spider-Man franchise but will now undoubtedly be swept under a rug with hopes it be forgotten by as many people as possible.What a massive massive shame and honestly I can't blame it on the actors because it's solely the fault of the story and the script. The action is bland and it just doesn't engage you at all. I was sat in the cinema hoping for something to happen and make me sit up in my seat and want to take note but it just limped along with all the pace of a lame dog. Sony I'm sure by now you realise this is a flop. If you want to actually do justice to the Spider-Man franchise please for the love of God just let Marvel do the whole job and stick your name on screen at the start.Nothing much more to say other than save yourself 2 hours of boredom and don't bother."
doczenith83-331-292453,2,Only review I've ever left on IMDB,"I've had an IMDB account for some time, but this is the only movie I came on here to leave a review for.It's so horribly done that the world needs to know to fully avoid it. The acting in particular is bad, the directing. Sony really needs to just give up their Marvel rights after this mega disaster.The only good thing about this movie are some of the fight seens with some special effects, but all that is relatively easy this day in age.If you see this review, I hope I helped save you a few hours of your life. You can do so many more interesting things than watch this movie. If someone even suggests watching this I recommend never even taking their movie advice seriously."
sierrastack,2,Truly wanted to leave,Truly wish we had skipped it. Maybe if this had been a movie with action with these cool young women kicking butt or Dakota being a badass for more than the last 5 minutes. But it wasn't. The script the directing the set up of shots and the editing all just fell so short it was like we weren't watching a marvel movie at all. There was not even the famous marvel scene after the credits. So don't wait around after the credits . In fact just don't go see it. I feel like the next movie where they get their powers is the movie I want to see but I don't know if it'll happen now or if I care unless they change the director and editing teams. Dakota was a weird choice but the other actresses deserved better and had the potential to be super badass female superheros. Something we need more of. Please be better for women everywhere.
iamsamsmith-77028,5,"""Worse than Morbius"", yeah right","I kept seeing headlines that this movie was worse than Morbius. I have watched Morbius once, tried to watch it a second time and don't remember anything but the Matt Smith dance scene.Madame Web was more engaging as a film. It definitely worked in its favour to have more lead characters as it got to focus on more character dynamics. The shots got a bit fancy if not over the top but at least kept the movie looking interesting. Some of it definitely reminded me of a really ass Raimi film.The movie is definitely crap, but at least it was kinda fun. No regrets watching this one while drunk. I still can't believe people thought this was worse than Morbius."
suraalyahya,7,Not as bad as people say,"The movie was entertaining, fun to watch and always kept me invested. I'm a huge marvel fan and have seen basically every marvel movie so I know that writing-wise it is not the best but it was overall a good watch. There are a few cringe dialogue scenes but it's not bad.If you're looking for the characters to all be full-fledged superheros this isn't for you, it's more like an origin story but has pretty cool scenes when madame web discovers she has powers. The character being a paramedic played a big part in adding more to her actions and there were some heart wrenching moments as well.Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie and would be excited to possibly see more of madame web in the future as her powers have great potential to be pretty cool."
bjk-97790,1,Stupid,"If marvel were to lose tens of billions of dollars and still made a movie, this is what I would expect. This has no plot, no backstop, or no sense. I would not make my worst enemy watch this cause it's too bad. It's a spider man movie except if Spiderman was 27 thousand dollars in debt. It was terrible. I would want to watch a child's movie instead of this. Random things appear outa nowhere. It's super fake and if I were to make a movie, it's be like this but with a better plot. This is so bad that it looks like it was made by a kid born in 2013. This was terrible and needs removed off of our planet."
wendy_tolson,10,Great movie,"I was pleasantly please with the movie. I've been waiting for it to come to Netflix for a long time. I'm really not sure why it is getting some low ratings. I think this is one of the best movies to come out in a really long time. I am glad to see a superhero movie with someone being demon possessed or it being a cheese fest.I really enjoyed the movie. I personally loved all of the acting, theatrics and cgi. All of the actors seemed to be natural and not over acting. The movie contains mild language. Which is a plus for movies now days. Will definitely be rewatching soon. I will be excited to watch the sequel."
CptJoker,6,Ridiculous reviews!,I generally don't watch movies and mostly tv shows. I bought a cinema subscription this year and watched more movies than I have in the last 10 years. I'm just leaving a review because the other ones are just objectively wrong.Needless to say this wasn't even the worst movie I saw this year nevermind of all time. I'm 100% convinced if the cast was male this would have a 5-7 and finally get why so many women complain about unfair voting.Was it good? Not really. Was it worse than most Marvel stuff? Not really.Overall not terrible and not great either. If you're bored and like superhero stuff this is probably worth a watch. If not you can probably skip it. If you don't like female leads skip it.
niermad,1,that was terrible!,"I could've caca'd in my hands and clapped and that would've been more of a plot line than whatever this was. The ending reminds me of someone doing hardcore drvgs and then putting it on a piece of paper and going, ""yep! This is it yall!"" i'm genuinely disappointed that some of these great actors decided to even go into this movie after reading the script. If you wanna watch it just to feel like you probably could've directed a better movie, you could! I watched llamageddon and that was better screenplay than this. Why did some of the lines not even cut in correctly for the villain and why was he actually stupid."
ojoon,5,"Not bad, not good, just nothing to write home about","Madame WebNow, the main allure of this movie apparently set in 2003 is nothing surprising if one is familiar with what I got an affinity for. An action sci-fi movie with a bunch of hot chicks?, yup, I'm in. But I think my lofty expectations did take a toll on me while watching this film, because while Madame Web isn't necessarily a bad movie, it certainly isn't a good one either, is it painfully dry and mediocre instead?, oh, absolutely. Like, I'mma be for real, and forgive my hectoring tone, Madame Web is nothing to write home about, it's hard for me to even give that much of an opinion regarding this thing, seeing how it gave me so little to write about!. The story's present and it makes sense considering what it's trying to present, a clairvoyant protagonist who's trying to prevent an imminent threat heading towards our other protagonists while the villain is ready to dish out said imminent threat with a motive of his own, okay. The characters are here and are playing their respective roles, okay. But am I the only one that detects a palpable rigidity and stiffness throughout the whole thing?, it certainly doesn't help that our protagonists are a bunch of attractive young ladies who were unfortunately hampered by a hefty amount of angst that obstructs any sort of fun to be elicited through the screen. And while it does admittedly give the movie some sort of gravitas that is needed for the emotional investment from the audience, is it really hitting the mark when the performances of the characters are this dry, soulless and condescending?. Seriously, it doesn't even try to hide the fact that the acting reeks of insincerity, which makes the tragic elements all the more frustrating to sit through and what aggravates the situation is the dialogue, that comes off so heavy-handed, you would swear that they're making these lines up as they go, with weird side plots like how Peter Parker is still in the womb of his mother, Mary and his absentee dad, Richard nowhere to be found, along with her brother-in-law, Ben Parker in the picture as she's dealing with pregnancy issues and how the movie does come with a message about embracing the future, but it's all done so half-heartedly, it has the impact of a regular dream one can remember about having in their sleep. And it's kinda disappointing when you know that there's a vestige of an attempt behind the scenes to sell you something powerful here, but instead of having hard-hitting moments that sticks with you long after the viewing experience is over, all you're going to get are simply intense moments that's relying way more on the portentous execution than what's actually being shown and how they're sold. Like, you can clearly tell what's taking place on screen but it's hard to emotionally invest in them for some reason due to its sheer clumsiness and what you end up with is a movie that would make even the most normal of humankind feel autistic for just under two hours!. Yeah, not even my unabashed concupiscence can make me enjoy this dull ""experience"", if you even wanna call it that. I swear, I've never felt this apathetic with a film ever, the Dune Part 2 and Godzilla vs. Kong sequel trailers that played before the movie were more exhilarating than this!. This is the worst kind of movie as it's not terrible for me to completely rip it apart nor was it good for me to praise it, it's a movie that admittedly does nothing for me, it has the emotional impact of a one-night stand and unless it's actually me and the four protagonists getting it on, I can't give this movie any more than a 5/10, I'm sorry. I can't even say it left a bad taste in my mouth, because there simply isn't one, it is what it is. The little Britney Spears Toxic joke is pretty cool though, what isn't cool is the fact that the triptych set of girls are not dancing provocatively enough in the diner on a table, but then again, if you have the emotional range of someone who literally just woke up, it's to be expected.5/10(720 words)"
christrent-97056,2,Boring garbage,"This one was rough to get through. My eyelids were actually getting heavier and heavier as the movie progressed. None of the main cast had any chemistry with each other at all, performances were lackluster, especially Dakota Johnson, but don't really blame her. And these three other girls that she is protecting, did not buy that they were teenagers at all....ik their age irl but it's still painfully obvious they are adults in this movie.These three ""kids"" don't even do anything even close to superhero-like for the WHOLE movie, excluding like 30 seconds of them fighting crime in their suits in visions of the future, that's it. They are just teens in danger for the entire movie! No character development that properly leads to becoming these badass Spider girls. The villain was also very boring. His entire character is he is trying to kill these girls before they become superheros and kill him, that's it. That's his ENTIRE character. Plus his post-production dubbing or whatever it's called SUCKS.This movie is just friggin boring. The action in this is not even action, just repetitive sequences of Madame Web seeing the future like in That's So Raven and immediately yells to a character to ""watch out"" and that's all it is, aside from when Web hits the boring evil Spider dude with an ambulance to save the ""teens"" and Ben Parker. The only time there's anything really actiony is in the climax battle, but I still didn't care. And how Web goes blind.....it's basically just ""ouch"" and she has no other reaction to it. She just lost her eyesight forever and.....has no realistic reaction to it.My only real positive I can give here is Adam Scott is pretty solid in this movie, gives a far better and more charismatic performance than this movie clearly deserves, which is the only reason why I even bother giving this movie two stars.....if I could, it'd just be one a half stars."
jcub-82877,1,It's very bad,"If I could give it 0 stars I would. My best advice would be just don't watch it don't waste your time. Thats why I won't go in depth and trash each individual scene it's not like there's nothing good at all, there's actually some good chemistry with the main cast. Just pair it with the fact that we have seen how great marvel can be with making movies and it looks like they put this movie together in about 30 minutes and were satisfied with filling 2024 with another flop because they just aren't quite ready to go into the next phase of marvel movies. It sucks that Iron Man and Captain America had to end but surely marvel studios can do better than this. Madame web really didn't even have any potential to begin with. I don't like to be so negative but it's a film where I left the theater not really disappointed... just sad that my pockets felt emptier. This film is something where you literally have nothing else to do so you put on during a lazy Sunday and fall asleep within the first 15 minutes or so."
make_me_think,4,I wanted it to be better...,"I really did. It's got a couple moments but it's woefully trite. I am all for powerful female roles and themes, I only wish that if the action genre is the vehicle that they'd be more along the lines of Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Lucy, Anna, Hanna, Red Sparrow, Salt, Atomic Blonde, etc. Not that everything has to be about spies or ultra violent but at least make the scripts good enough that schleps like me don't think they could have written a better script. The cast had promise but as someone else said they were wasted in this one. The only reason to watch this one is so that it is successful enough for studios to invest in more female led movies."
Sam_Medina,1,Who Should Have Won The Razzie Award in This One?,"There should be a negative rating... It's more of a bad drama... No sense of urgency or pacing... This continues to happen as they( the ones in charge) think star power will make the movie. I think every aspect of this mess ( I won't call it a film) is more of a mess each second it continues...
The bad guy is really bad...omg..lol... All for about 80,000,000 dollars. Amd maybe another 50,000,000 to promote... and the fights? Or action or lack there of... The Old system hadn't learned... After all the streaming wars and abundant amount of contents , they had to put this one on for free extremely quick since no one would purchase or rent it."
indianajonze,6,"I know it's fashionable to hate this film, but...","It really wasn't bad. A lot of interesting concepts here. My only real criticism is with the bad guy. He's poorly fleshed out and his voice was over the top ""hey i'm a villain"". Also i would have liked to have at least gotten a hint about how the girls ended up with their powers that we saw demonstrated in the dream sequences. As it stands we're left (even after the end credits) having no idea how they became superheroes in the first place, because the entire film has them as just some stupid helpless teenage girls. Otherwise it was a pretty charming film. Watch it with an open mind, it's not nearly as bad as everyone pretends it is."
frutkoff,5,Not a Spidey Type Movie,"Not a Spidey Movie, Just related to the same world. If you were looking for our favorite
crime fighting vigilante swinging from skyscrapers - ITS NOT THAT!Spider-Man aside, I didn't hate the movie...
But wasn't close to loving it either.I guess it's hard not to sound cliche when you redo the same franchise over and over but spider-verse nailed it.. and parts of this were played into clique universe all the way.It felt a bit cheap and bland at times..
Dakota was half assing her part for several scenes, and the Andrew Tate type villain was a bit cringe at times. Was it a massive flop? No.Just a basic simple, ok movie."
threykat,6,"Not horrible, but not great","There are a couple things that really drag this down. The dialogue is seriously stilted, to the point where you have to wonder if Ezekiel Sims' lines are all dubbed. Secondly is the pacing of the plot. At this point there have been plenty of well done origin stories out there, so it's less acceptable to get such a clunky product. I do feel like it's worth a watch, provided that the expectation for anything deep, or genre defining, is not brought in with you.As a side note, you're left wondering how much of what foundation is laid here actually with be used in the future, or if this will end up being a stand-alone movie."
stanislastabori,4,The most anticlimactic superhero movies ever!,"I'm gonna rate the movie 4 out of 10. Before I delve deeper into the movie, I'm gonna point out the only thing I really enjoyed. The concept of ""time heist"" is usually something that can't really go wrong. Because we, as the viewers, are stimulated to guess what is the movie about to unfold. Unfortunately, Madame Web wasn't the best example.First of all, the acting was awful. I believe that Dakota is a great actress, but I didn't think I see that throughout the movie. She can't even cry on command, the emotion was very flat. The other cast are also kind of influenced by that. Secondly, why is it so rushed? I feel like the director wants to end the movie as soon as posible. From the beginning of the movie, when Cassie's mom found the spider, Ezekiel almost immediately kill all of the crews. Cassie also portrayed to be hating his mom her whole life, because of SOMETHING THE MOVIE DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT. She seems fine untill she decide not to. We only learn that she holds a grudge to her mom when it was near ending. The revelation also so brief, it happened only like 3 minutes. There are zero context whatsoever about what is the state of Cassie's relation with her deceased mom. Lastly, I kept asking ""where is the action?"" Believe me guys, the movie shows so little action. My 10 fingers weren't all up when it came to count the action. The whole movie feel like stretched out, filled with unimportant things where it can be. Filled with something else useful. I almost didn't realise when the movie reached the climax. It was just, plain.... I think Madame Web made Morbius like one of the Nolan's movie."
jmbovan-47-160173,4,"Not Horrible, but Not Very Good Either","Madame Web established a simple concept for an origin story, then they made it convoluted with their attempts of time travel. But the worse failure on the maker's part is that they made it boring.So, a woman is seeking a particular spider while heavily pregnant so she can harness the apparent healing properties to make ""medical miracles."" And their is a legend of ""Spider People"" who live in the jungle around this spider.Now that child is Dakota Johnson, paramedic in NYC (I believe). She starts having ""visions"" of events to occur. She goes about following these to avert damage.I give Dakota Johnson a half round of applause. The first half of the film she actually displaced emotions in her performance, more than I've seen her in any other film. (Maybe in Bad Times of the El Royale she displayed some level of emotion.)The story next incorporated three teen girls for fun (?) as they become integral to the plot. But ""Surprise!"" Do they really matter?I was having fun with the film in the first half. Then all these surprise elements kept coming. And Ms. Johnson would limp to another idea, sigh, ponder, and then limp to another scene. And the teens were perfect stereotypes of the main three tropes, and clash with each other. Doing nothing for the plot.Madame Web feels like they started with something that could have at least been fun. But everyone seemed to become lethargic, and the plot unfolded as if it was an improv game: ""Yes, and..."" This made the second half drag from scene to scene.So a 4 for some of the fun to be had. Ms. Johnson display a glint of depth, and that is more than I typically see from her. A couple cool concepts were on display. But over it was a waste and probably deserved a 2-3."
kcrew98,4,"It just felt, flat...","This might have worked better as a series rather than a movie - more time for the plot to realize it had potential. Dakota Johnson did her best, but the script had all the excitement of a damp napkin. Character development sprinted toward the end - like it had to catch a plane, but the whole ""shared bond through trauma"" angle fell flat when half the characters barely exchanged pleasantries. The film needed depth. If this movie was aimed at teens, it seriously needs smarter dialogue - think Peter Parker and his friends, not a script that feels like it was written on a lunch break. The villain was standard fare, actually quite boring, surrounded by flashy scenes (why spend all this money Sony?) that tried to distract from the narrative black hole."
Jesy929,3,Wrong Actors and a bad script,"The entire movie seemed very low budget until it came to blowing some stuff up, which is where they must have put their budget. Dakota just doesn't have the kind of onscreen persona that can carry off being a protector.The film seemed to be produced by men who have no clue as to who young females are. Getting up and dancing on a table in a diner? No, just no. That whole scene is so awkward and seems like some lusty old man wanted it in there to get his jollies.The younger women, the 3 that are in danger, just fell flat. They weren't given much for personalities and they all just get a long great for no reason, and never a conflict.The entire movie seemed so one dimensional. The entire part where she went to 'learn' about her beginnings was so quick and so uneventful. Dakota continued to fall flat and didn't look as if she could fake the emotions she was supposed to be having.Another hollywood production that relies on some blow it ups to make everything okay in the end... and it didn't work. Even they weren't that good.My suggestion, skip this one. You aren't missing anything, nor do you learn any part of the universe within this flick."
kyngeemporium,4,"Cool Idea, BAD Pacing","Great idea... but the pacing is very bad and the dialog boring and unimaginative. They are doing too much at once and not taking time to build any relationships... is it about Cass and these girls? Cass and her mom? Cass discovering her gifts and fighting her moms murderer? Are we doing a jungle awakening thing? Are we concerned about her EMT career? PICK. You can't do all of this and do it well in an hour and a half.Relationships they spend half the movie on don't get the pay off... instead you get a pay off scene with characters we hardly ever see... her and the girls could have been fun, or comedic... but it's just dry... and any oportunity for well placed humor is not taken.This should have been TV or 2 movies to get all this properly done.One thing I can say is there doesn't seem to be any dumb wokism terms in it and women in it although they are the heros are not just flinging men around like rag dolls with no good explanation. Cass is protecting these girls through her quick thinking, EMT driving skills, and seeing the future...I'd say watch it once if your board and have nothing else... then movie on."
sheriefemad,7,Much better rate,"Madame Web, a film that weaves a tapestry of emotions, has left a lasting impression on me. With its unique blend of supernatural elements and human drama, this movie manages to resonate with its audience on multiple levels. As a movie critic, I rate it a 7 out of 10.The plot revolves around a mystical psychic, Madame Web, who uses her extraordinary abilities to guide and protect a young girl with extraordinary powers. The themes and tone of the film are intriguing, exploring the complexities of fate, destiny, and the power of choice. These themes are woven seamlessly into the narrative, providing a thought-provoking experience for the viewers.The acting in Madame Web is commendable, particularly the lead actress who brings depth and vulnerability to her character. The supporting cast also delivers strong performances, making the audience feel emotionally invested in their journeys. The characters are well-developed and relatable, allowing the audience to connect with them on a deeper level.One cannot ignore the cinematography and production design, which create a visually stunning world that is both captivating and immersive. The special effects are impressive, particularly those involving the psychic realm, which adds a sense of wonder and magic to the story.In conclusion, Madame Web is a film that transcends the boundaries of the superhero genre, offering a unique and engaging cinematic experience. Despite some minor flaws, it is a movie that will leave you pondering long after the credits roll."
Meeka_Meek,5,Could've been better,"The movie wasn't as bad as critics make it out to be, but it definitely could've been better. I think the main problem lies within the casting Directors as I feel they did not make the right decisions - especially with Dakota Johnson. I think she's great But she doesn't have a wide range of characteristics she can play and at best she should stick to rom-coms. This movie needed a bad a*s (Charlize Theron, Angela Bassett , Mila jovich, Michelle Rodriguez) , and Dakota gave stoner girl next door. The performance ultimately felt lazy and careless. The antagonist was nothing more than forgettable. I don't even remember his name. This movie needed a diabolical man (Christopher Waltz, John Malkovich, Samuel Jackson) and what he gave was pissed off drama queen. The three other girls in the movie also needed a little more pizzazz , all 3 of them combined failed to bring girl power this movie needed to be great. All and all the movie feels like a rough draft. If they hadn't screwed this up there could have be 1 or 2 more solid movies to bank on.. I yearn for the day Hollywood can get a Woman led action movie right."
nicolio10,8,Not sure what the other reviews are about?,"I enjoyed this one. I think the current rating is way too harsh.I found the story interesting and I really like Dakota Johnsons character. I like the time jumping concept which is what really won me over.The 3 girls story could have been developed more and the scenes in Peru. However, they all worked well on screen together.It would also have been great to see her push her abilities even further beyond what we expect from seeing the future to some concepts not thought of before (although they did touch on one which was cool).However I will say I'm not sure if it would be a series I would continue to watch as I feel a bit burnt out from the superhero movies and it seems to be going more into that (and the point of the whole movie).My advice would be ignore the ratings, it's worth the watch.From someone who goes to the movies every week and enjoys the blockbusters lol."
simonjh1973,7,I kind of enjoyed it,"Watched this not expecting to even bother watching it all (like marvels).But strangely I enjoyed it
Sure the CGI isn't the best, the story is also not that exciting so nothing much happens, but I did enjoy it and I'm still wondering why.The villain is terrible and has plenty of opportunities to kill the 3 girls , but tends to just throw them instead.This could have been a great film is they changed various bits of it , slightly changing the story would have helped and might have been better if people knew what madame webb really was/is.But now there is no chance of this as it bombed.I was disappointed at the end as well knowing full well that the main characters wouldn't become who they are meant to be.If you haven't seen it , give it a chance."
trumpisafatpileofshit,2,How did this get made?!?!,"I know you are going to watch it anyway so let me fill you in. You're thinking, hey it's Dakota ""50 shades of"" Johnson, and that chick from Euphoria, plus it's a Marvel and it was in theaters, it can't be that bad? WRONG! (TL;DR: Madame Web = hella doo doo)At first I thought that maybe they had a super small budget, because of how cheap looking it is, but there are sooooo many blatant product placements that it's cringe to the max.Then I thought that maybe the script was written by ai, because the dialogue is soooo horrendous... but honestly a Speak-&-Spell getting punched by a monkey could've written a better script.The acting is awful and they had to have known it, so maybe they made this whole film with one-take scenes. Maybe they're training the younger generations to accept bad writing and bad acting as a way to boost profits. Maybe it's some sort of cinematic shrinkflation, it looks like a regular size movie, it still says Marvel, but the action is smaller and cheaper and more fake. The cgi is better than MS Paint and better than that craptastic Flash movie that just came out, but it's still a total rush job, and so you can visibly see all the corners they cut. Even the villain's voice sounds fake.Also, keep in mind that half the movie is her having visions of the future, so you see much of the dialogue and scenes TWICE! - Meaning that this is basically like 58 cheap minutes of badly acted crap, repeated, stretched, and with a butt-ton of filler, to add up to a runtime of 1 hour and 56 minutes of plops, flops, and when will it stops?!I suppose the one silver lining is that at least we all know that Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson have done alot of nude scenes before, so we can take out our phones and google that instead of watching Madame Web."
hondajox,3,You're not missing anything,"Don't get me wrong, I'm someone that needs to watch something themselves to make an opinion, if you want to watch if, watch it. But this movie is so utterly boring and the acting is almost unbearable. Dakota whatever literally cannot act and I don't know how she is still casted. I'm someone that tries to look at every aspect of a movie and genuinely give it the benefit of the doubt and point out some positives. This movie is just boring and I LOVE marvel. Watch it or don't but it's honestly terrible. The story is so chaotic and not fluid. The writing is terrible. I feel bad because I love Adam Scott. But it's almost unwatchable. Just my opinion."
dark-phoenix84,1,Madam Gabbu!!!,"The acting by all actresses is so artificial that, they might as well have got robots to act instead of asking these women and paying them for it. Each one's facial expression throughout the movie is like it was carved out of plastic.The plot is so full of holes and lacking common sense that, it makes them look like dumb heroes rather than superheroes.The villian and supporting actors try to make up for the bad acting & poor story to some extent but, by the end of the movie even that falls apart due to the story.It's a CWOT and nothing else comes close to describing it. Watching a dendrophile hug trees is more captivating than this..."
cheftoni55,4,Where's a black widow when one needs get?,"Was pet-sitting at my neighbor's and originally put this movie on to keep their pet company. Decided to give it a watch, because the trailers intrigued me.It was just not good. The script was garbage, the acting wooden, the direction nonexistent, pacing off. It could've been so much more. Perhaps it should've been written as a mini-series, just for character-developmemt sake? Also, I'm unsure if it was my imagination, but the lead antagonist's dialogue was dubbed. The ""technology"" being used in the movie, *by one person* and the results are deeply stupid and completely impossible. And as a lifelong Marvel girl, I'm well-versed in suspension of disbelief. Ugh."
ppvysr,2,Character development,"I had limited hopes for this movie and am glad that I watched it on Netflix. If I had paid to watch this movie; I would likely have gouged my eyes out. The character development was nonexistent entirely; I have pretty good comic book knowledge, specifically of the spiderverse; but to include a villain and three additional ""distractions"" that solely rely on name and not at least giving some insight into who they are is mind boggling. Was this film written by five year olds looking to simply create a new superhero team? The three additional female heroes came with zero back story and also lacked a fore story about just who they were. The villain knew these three characters were supposed to kill him in the future; but never said why. Entirely unsure of his motivation."
lambiepie-2,2,"Gee-whiz, what was this?","To me, Madame Web's main flaw was the deceptive trailer, which initially piqued my interest.The trailer heavily emphasized three spidey-type young ladies in masks, like superhero-ish things, and a lady messing around with webs. That seemed interesting enough, so I watched the film on a streaming service.Boy, did I discover how much of a bald-faced lie that trailer was to the film! Nothing is more deceiving to an audience than a trailer like that. I was waiting to see something more than a ""dream projection"" of what may happen if they had high hopes for Madame Web 2 to explain; it was not a good move, as Madame Web lost my interest and was a waste of time entirely.One of the most profound letdowns of Madame Web was the stark contrast between the promising trailer and the actual film. I was eagerly anticipating a narrative that would showcase the young ladies, with Madame Web, portrayed by Dakota Johnson, taking on a central role. However, this promising premise was nowhere to be found in the film, leaving me feeling deceived.Frankly, there needed to be less overdrawn-out backstory before getting to the essence or purpose of Madame Web. (and maybe Madame Web was too young to be a Madame?!! ). For example, Madame Web's origin tale could have taken 10-12 minutes at most.Then, get right to the young ladies' potentials and how they connect and become a unit (do they become a unit?!). Tell the audience why. Did Madame Web hit them up with some spidey serum? Taking them on a field trip to Chile, and they all fell into a spider cave? All of them got sick, and Madame Web gave them a blood transfusion? WHAT?!?! They could have also told us about their previous ""teen"" life that led them to young lady spiders in a 2-minute cut dream sequence. Misfire!Then there was the spidery-type man, played by Tahar Rahim. He just had no way to go in this script with the character's quest to kill the young ladies before they got older and could kill him. He built an empire. Okay. Could we have had a better peek into that? But then again, eh, who cares? This character has misfires, too.There are just too many misfires all around, which is why I cannot recommend this one."
shepard-00522,7,Not that bad,"There is a lot of people jumping on the hate bandwagon. Sure, it's not a Epic. I would not even call it a hit. But, I've seen worse. I liked the story and the setting. The acting was not bad, although not amazing. I liked the special effects and really enjoyed watching it. I would say, go in with an open mind and relax. It's not as bad as people say.I think it would have been better with a closer toe to Spiderman. Maybe a Cameo from Tom Holland in a post credit scene. I would have liked to see more of the Spidergirls.I still would not call it the worst movie ever. I think it has gotten a bad wrap."
Special-K88,,let's not try this again...,"In early 2000s New York City paramedic and loner Cassie lives a pretty uneventful life outside of her job, but things are about to reach a whole new level of crazy for her. Experiencing visions which she initially dismisses as déjà vu, she comes to realize she possesses a clairvoyance that allows her to see the future. Her newfound powers may be linked to her late mother who was researching spiders in the Peruvian Amazon prior to her death, as well as a mysterious indigenous tribe known as Las Arañas, but Cassie has bigger things to worry about when she finds herself becoming the de facto protector of impulsive, entitled teenagers Julia Cornwall, Añya Corazón, and Mattie Franklin. Errant visual effects, crummy lines, along with uninvolving action scenes are all that's peppered throughout a prolonged, paradoxical story that's rarely (if ever) interesting, not to mention replete with characters who lack charisma, including a most forgettable villain. The sappy and sentimental ending doesn't help, but the ship sunk long before the finale. *½"
ibonish,1,Marky B from Woburn MA,"I wouldn't go see this movie again if it was playing for free. This was hands-down, not only the worst superhero movie I've ever seen quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The story was horrible. The actors were lackluster at best. There wasn't one redeeming quality about this film even the costumes look cheesy for them superheroes I don't know who at Sony Green lit this project and then actually let it into theaters but they will not make profit on this, it's absolutely garbage. Don't waste your time or your money seeing this film. If you haven't seen Beekeeper try that, way better film. The action is actually intense!HONESTLY THIS MOVIE DESERVES A NEGATIVE SCORE -5 out of 10. Absolutely embarrassing."
spm-vertigo,8,Surprisingly Good entry in the extended Spider-Man Universe,"I do not understand all the negative reviews of this movie. My 18 year old son and I went to see it this morning and as the end credits rolled we both said, wow that was really good. I went in with low expectations having read some of the hate for this movie, I can only assume some people just jumping on the bandwagon of hate for ""super hero"" movies, to try and be fashionable. If you don't like this type of movie don't watch it. Wouldn't surprise me if half the people leaving hateful reviews have not even watched it, probably just seen the trailer, as the reviews do not match the movie I just watched. If you love Marvel and the Spider Man universe, then you should enjoy this movie. The characters were engaging and funny, nothing wrong with the dialogue in my opinion. As an origin story movie, I thought it well scripted. The action sequences were well choreographed and thought out. Special effects were excellent. It was generally a fun and entertaining movie. Looking forward (hopefully) to a sequel.Ignore the hate, if you like Marvel and Spider Man, go and watch it and make your own mind up."
pfranklin-06328,6,"Not an Oscar, but...","Not Oscar winning, but kept me interested from start to finish. People are so critical. But overall it was entertaining nothing new, better than Argyle which we thought was totally OTT. It deserves more than a 3, makes it sound awful and it wasn't. My wife and I enjoyed it (in our 50's) and my mother in law who is 83 enjoyed it too!Dakota Johnson was far removed from 50 Shades and we thought she played her part well. It's a shame a follow up movie is not going to be made as we would definitely go and see it. It's a shame this was panned, it deserved a far better score. Looking forward to Marvel's next offering."
RichardMcDonaldOhio,1,Worst thing since the plague,"Honestly I dont even know what to write, couldnt get myself to watch 30 minutes of this without subway surfers on the side of the screen. Horrible acting, horrible script, horrible editing. Give me the time back you have taken of my life. I knew movies released in 2024 are a big gamble but this movie was like going all in with your life savings and then being hit by a car. Every part of the movie was just poorly made, it looked like it was directed by a kid, and the casting selection was more laughable than a Adam Sandlers comedy. I could write a 10000 word eassay on just how bad this movie is. DONT WATCH IT."
Lomax343,3,"It's not bad, it's just boring","It's a superhero story. It covers the bases and ticks all the boxes - and gives us nothing we haven't seen done much better a dozen times before.We get an origin story involving a spider (where have I seen that before?), a character growing up not knowing the powers they have (where have I seen that before?), a villain whose sole purpose in the film is to be villainous (where have I seen that before?), and so on and so on. Plus lots of plot conveniences that just suggest lazy writing.As an aside, five different people are credited for writing the story or the screenplay (or both). The result was not an example of committee work at its best.Naturally, it all ends in a flashy bashy crashy sequence - but this one was so tame and so lacking in thrills, excitement, or anything superheroic that they might as well not have bothered.To top it off, we get Sydney Sweeney playing a teen less than a month after we saw her playing a mid-twenties romantic lead in Anyone but You. Has Madame Web spent five years in limbo whilst someone tried to get something watchable out of the mess? If so, it was five years wasted.Madame Web's superpower, of course, is to see into the future. It's a shame she didn't see clearly enough to stop this being made."
OfficialMrTech,5,Total waste of time and money.,"Madame Web features Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Emma Roberts. The movie was directed by S. J. Clarkson who also directed ""The Defenders"".The story was supposed to be a lot more dark and cinematic and really enticing to watch, but it went in the other direction. As soon as I saw the cast I was assured that this is going to be a really good movie, but thanks to the adjustments made in post production the movie became a more of a faliure. Dakota Johnson even said that the film she shot was ""unrecognizable"" from the version of the script she signed on to make.But over all with respect to the actors and crew members(not including directors and writers) It deserves a 5/10 rating,"
bwc-maneke,1,Horrible campy acting not even Ms. Johnson could save,"I had a feeling starting it but with Dakota Johnson in it we figured we'd try it. It started out well enough but went down hill super quick.It was bad and I mean REALLY Bad!The acting was super cringe, flat, campy and just so cliche that I literally was asked wtf are we watching.Im not sure if its the writers fault, the directors or the actors but you folks really missed with your own target audience.You propose these 'bad ass super heros' without any of the hero journey. You want us to like characters you have to make them likeable, not inept, flat and two dimensional that can barely be called a person.Its honestly a wonder how these corporations can even stay in business when they shell out for these hollow films and cancel the ones that fans actually liked."
Mykewood,3,"Bad story, bad writing, False advertising.","The scene of spider girls fighting a spider guy is a dream sequence. It's about 30 seconds & is shown early. The rest of the time, the girls are teenagers. Dakota uses her newly discovered ability to see briefly into the future (think Nick Cage in Next), to run from the spider guy. He's trying to kill the girls due to his recurring dream of them killing him in the future. Of course, it's never explained why they would kill him. His criminal exploits all revolve around finding the girls. He's clearly been looking for them for a long time. Outside of that, it doesn't appear he's wanted by the police or anyone else. So what is going on? We get no answers. Also his audio is dubbed, badly. Dakota is a neurotic mess for most of the film. We see glimpses of what she sees using her abilities, and they mostly confuse her. Then suddenly, with 5 mins left in the film, mid scene, her entire demeanor shifts. She suddenly has full confidence in her abilities and how it all works. We stop seeing her visions. And she starts talking like the Madame Web character. She knows everything that is happening and will happen. Including the death of the villain, and ensuing accident which blinds and cripples her. Then the next scene, a few days later, she's in a wheelchair, with reflective glasses on, and starts talking about the girls like they are her beloved children. The dialogue is cliched & cringe, and delivered completely deadpan. The change is extremely jarring. It makes you feel like you missed something. 3/10 don't bother."
obigeneral,6,"Entertaining, but a bit poor for 2024","The film is not that bad. Social media is butchering it because it gives more visibility, but it's not that bad. The first half is entertaining, even refreshing. The final part is poor. But it's certainly better than the last Marvel movies.I find all the editing of these premonitions over-edited and somewhat confusing. Also, I think they could have given the development of the third act a twist so that even the viewer would find the conclusion of the third act unexpected.On the other hand, although less important, the lack of money in the project is noticeable. The movements of the bad guy in action were almost nineties. ""Just fast forward and they won't notice""."
ravinderpbwala,1,Worst script ever,"Entire movie is basically a chase scene. There were no special event or worth noticing moments. The thing i hated the most was boring script and story plus cheap acting. Watched only because it was from marvel. The guy who wanted to kill teenage girls had nothing like professionals do, all he did was to rely on database which was only deduced from traffic camera and controls. Vfx is worse than eternals . The entire movie was just straight forward and no twists involved. No thrill with minimal action. I swear if you watched this movie you are gonna waste your 2 hour and you will get to know completely nothing."
rcuttill,8,I went expecting to see a terrible movie but didn't.,"I went expecting to see a terrible movie but didn't. I'm not saying it's the greatest but it's not unwatchable. I found it quite pleasant and engaging. I've seen far worse. The plot is intriguing. It's a voyage of discovery about hidden powers and also clearly has a sequel in mind. It skips about, such as bits in Peru, but that does follow the narrative. I agree with some that the villain isn't the baddest but he's passable. They clearly play with a mixed trio of teenage girls and gives it some of the humour, although there's not much laugh out loud humour. This is long from being the best Marvel movie but although way down the list it's not the worst. There aren't a huge number of fight scenes but overall the film is adequate. Don't go in with the expectation of a blockbuster but you will see a modest superhero movie."
ahmad_Hasan,7,I mean come on now people,"This was one of the much better spin-offs Sony Has made off of spider-man. Thanks to the cast (besides the villain and 'pregnant' Emma Roberts) and the director's coherent work this destined-to-be-stoned vehicle was actually charmingly kitsch and held its own. I found myself caring for Cassy throughout. The other three girls had really good chemistry. This could've been what all this negativity-it's-getting wanted it to be but it managed surpassing it all. Go see it if you're looking for a fast fun flick that does not take itself seriously. It's a KFC sort of film, sure. But it was made fresh so you'll enjoy the bucket."
daltonvegh,1,2nd Worst movie I have ever watched,It was horrible It was worst then the Marvel's movie I saw It sure didn't feel like a marvel movie It was really dark like all the DC movies and DC comics If I would have known It was going to be this God awful movie I would never used my movie gift card I highly recommend nobody go and watch this horrible movie I was not entertained at all I really wish I read the reviews before going to see this movie I truly wish I could give Madame Web a zero star review this movie doesn't even deserve a single star rating It was completely trash I sure hope Madame Web won't be In phase five marvel Is way better off scraping this movie I think the fantastic four remake and Madame Web ties.
ehrar,1,Could have been a lot better,"Madame Web"" ensnares viewers in a web of disappointment, failing to capture the intrigue and charm of its source material. The film suffers from a convoluted and uninspired plot, throwing together underdeveloped characters and nonsensical situations. Dakota Johnson struggles to find depth in the titular role, burdened by a script that offers little character development or meaningful motivations. The supporting cast fares no better, with talented actors like Sydney Sweeney and Tahar Rahim wasted on one-dimensional characters.Visually, the film resembles a low-budget video game cutscene, lacking the polish and grandeur expected from a superhero film. The action sequences, when present, are uninspired and poorly choreographed, failing to deliver any thrills or excitement. Even the film's attempts at humor fall flat, landing with a dull thud instead of a laugh.""Madame Web"" is a frustrating misstep, offering nothing new or engaging for either loyal fans or newcomers. It's a film devoid of any spark, leaving viewers with a sense of wasted potential and a lingering question: how could something with such promise unravel so spectacularly?"
arsalanweb,1,Entangled in a Web of Woe,"Madame Web swings into theaters with all the grace of a toddler tangled in Christmas lights. The film wastes a potentially intriguing premise on a clunky script, bargain-basement effects, and action sequences that would struggle to impress a high school film class.Dakota Johnson tries her best, but even she can't elevate the lifeless dialogue and paper-thin characters. The story lurches from scene to scene, dumping exposition like a malfunctioning backpack. Meanwhile, the special effects are a blurry mess, leaving you wondering if you accidentally bought a 3D ticket without the glasses.Avoid this cinematic catastrophe at all costs. Save your money and rewatch Spider-Man 2 for a superhero origin story done right. Madame Web is a tangled mess that will leave you feeling more confused than Cassandra Webb herself."
vdrwlf,1,Avoid at all costs - even in the face of curiosity,"Goes without saying that this is the single worst way to spend 2 hours, ever. Everyone involved with this movie should be immediately fired. I can't imagine even approving the script - let alone filming it and then signing off on releasing it.Remember when WB effectively deleted the Batwoman movie and rolled it into a tax write off because it was so bad? I can't imagine it was worse than this.... This movie is truly a horrifying experience. Start to finish.Sony should forfeit the rights to ever produce another movie - let alone a Spider-Man one. Shame. The purest of shame. If you liked this movie at any point - I feel sorry for you."
andrew-714-873248,1,So disappointed.,"I didn't believe the bad reviews, but after watching with my son... it's such a poorly entertaining movie I hated it.I had so much hope, but here are the reasons it sucks so bad.#1. POOR PLOT LINE. The character development is horrendous. So much potential and a big flat ZERO. The characters have no fully understood interesting and consistent purpose other than the fact they are all women. That's all.#2. The lipsych of the villain was worse than anime - I do not comprehend why his voice was not matching his lips. His poison from his hand makes no sense. Stupid.#3. The logical motivations of the girls was stupid. They had no specific purpose and Sydney's hairstyle didn't match the character. Dumb.#4. The stupid tie-in of ""Once you find Responsibility you will find your Power"" is an insult to Spiderman... the way Casey get injured doesn't match the accident. Stupid.#5. The ending was the worst. Her mismatching sunglasses and cliche taglines of ... it's the clearest I've ever seen... dumb.Overall irritating movie really. I wasted money in the theatres. I should have wait until it was free."
loradoom,1,Product Placement/Promotion,"Rather than following along with the story, I found myself wondering how much money Pepsi invested to have such prominent product placement and branding in nearly every scene. I don't mind seeing a brand name in a movie, but this is the first time I've watched one where it was so in your face. There's even a scene where Dakota makes sure to turn her can of Pepsi around in her hand so that the name is facing the camera, which felt like it was just to make sure you saw the name on the can as it served no other purpose. I think they had her fidget with the tab on the soda cans in nearly every scene so your eyes were drawn to it as well even when you didn't have the logo prominently on the screen. I blame the director for it being so obvious throughout the entire movie. There had to have been a better way to represent the brand without it taking away from the movie so much.Don't get me wrong, I have nothing bad to say about Pepsi. I'm a Mountain Dew addict through and through. This was just over the top in your face. I think we'd have all rather have had a line or two where a character asked another if they wanted a Pepsi rather than see the can or logo in nearly every scene. For me, it ended up being super distracting. Then again, the acting was a bit painful, so maybe my mind was just wandering to the props more because it was better than watching the actors trying to pull off the awkward script they were given. It felt like the director spent too much time telling them to make sure the Pepsi logo was facing towards the camera if they had a soda for the scene and not enough time trying to make the characters less one dimensional.***Spoilers Below***You know it's bad when even the warehouse they end up at for the climax had to have a giant Pepsi marquee on top, and (as if that wasn't enough) one of the letters falling from the sign is what caused the villain to meet his demise. Pepsi didn't just kill the villain, it killed the movie with the over the top product placement."
sinamashafi,6,Worth watching,"I actually had much lower expectations after the trailer but the movie is not that bad. It has many flaws but the story actually seems interesting and there are some good scenes. The cast is actually interesting and they are all acting well and I really liked the whole concept but there are many things that ruin the mood, so many bugs and holes in the story, terrible voice over and lack of development for the characters...
I hope they won't cancel the number two and actually make a well made for the next chapter because it can be such a cool story with interesting characters. By the way the film has a very cool soundtrack!"
bash-47458,1,How did this movie get me so lost when nothing happend?,"This movie got me so lost on what was happening, but yet nothing happened. The spider fights from the trailer was nothing but visions and the movie looked like a Minecraft manhunt. The suits they showed in the visions was never even given to the girls! The characters bored me and made me loose interest way too fast. I was intrigued to watch this with my friends and now I immediately regret itI didn't even know what the hell was happening with Madame web's character so I just gave up in caring. I am so relieved that I didn't pay for this mistake of a movie! I feel so bad for the people who did."
sacksharry,10,Most powerful film in 7000 years!,"The man who lives inside the ice machine at 7/11 recommended this to me
In between grunting, scratching and screaming about demons in his toes he explained the story of Madame Web to me and I just knew if I didn't force my family to watch this film I would be hurting them. They thanked me and couldn't believe how this film changed their lives for the better. I went back to thank ice machine guy but sadly he was taken by a random lion attack while skydiving.. some say if you put your ear to the machines door you can still hear Madame Web playing right behind the lion roars and screaming. I know he's in paradise now cheering all of you on watching this masterpiece!"
BLAlley,6,"Rushed and some poor editing, but enjoyable","I honestly don't understand the binary nature of modern audiences. If something isn't the greatest thing ever then it's deemed complete garbage. That's a terrible way to approach anything let alone something as trivial as entertainment. All such people do is deny themselves a respite from the true woes we all face.Some of the animation was off, but so what? Some of the best movies ever made have scenes of people in cars that are obviously in front of a projection screen, but we don't fault that because it's not the point. The point of any effect, special or visual, is to tell us what is happening in the story.Some of the editing in the ""time"" scenes could have used more care, but even then the point came across.Perhaps the biggest flaw is trying to tell too much story in a two hour movie. I think it could have benefited from focusing on Ezekiel discovering Cassandra and seeing her as a threat. Then you introduce the girls in the second movie, or do something entirely different.Even so, it was enjoyable enough and doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving. It's a movie, not a cancer diagnosis. Lighten up, Francis."
AndyLianB,1,Absolutely terrible!,"Blimey, I can't express to you the disappointment at how awful this movie is. I watched this for 45 minutes until I turned it off. 45 minutes I will never get back. Terrible!One thing I have to applaud for the contribution to the failure of this movie is Dakota Johnson's nauseating acting, bloody hell she can't act.The storyline of it all it's all hazed & quite tedious if I'm honest, which was one of the reasons I turned it off. I have to say this is the worst marvel film I've partially watched.Overall I'd highly recommend you avoid this movie & Dakota's awkwardly terrible acting at all costs."
tohiduzzaman,1,I expected big,"Uninspired performances and a script that feels like it was written by an AI with a glitch, Madame Web creates feeling more bewildered than entertained. The action sequences is so bad that i wished i should have been stayed home ðŸ˜­It stumbles onto the big screen with all the grace of a drunken spider. This disastrous attempt at superhero storytelling weaves a tangled mess of nonsensical plotlines and forgettable characters. With CGI effects that look like they were recycled from a 90s video game and dialogue so cringeworthy it could make a supervillain cringe, Madame Web fails to capture the imagination or excitement of its comic book origins. Even the most forgiving fans of the genre will struggle to find anything redeeming about this arachnid abomination. Save your time and your by avoiding Madame Web ."
kukupink,2,Bad acting,"While the plot was lacking, Dakota Johnson's performance was particularly grating, her consistent expression throughout every scene accentuating her limited acting range. This, coupled with the contrived storyline, only served to highlight her shortcomings as an actress. The lackluster performances of the three sidekicks further weakened the overall casting.Regarding the proliferation of Spider-Man movies, it's puzzling why they continue to produce mirrored versions. With numerous iterations and parallel universe storylines already in existence, it begs the question of originality. There's a plethora of fascinating characters awaiting development within the superhero genre that could offer refreshing narratives."
UnderTheScene,3,Her web connects them all,"Sony's latest installment into their Spider-Man Universe was a tough watch. While I can admit the concept of the film was one that I did enjoy but the execution was poorly done. From the opening scene to the end credits, it was just constant bad dialogue, choppy editing, poor acting, and brutal CGI. Felt more like a comedy about someone who can see the future than a superhero film. I think the standout actor in this film goes to Adam Scott as Ben Parker with his character feeling the most authentic with very little screen time. Lastly, I must say that Tahar Rahim (Ezekiel Sims) was one of the worst villains in film history and easily will be one of my most forgettable ones.""Madame Web"" ended up feeling like a rushed project and landing as the worst film of the year. Probably one of the worst comic book films ever made. The only hope is that ""Kraven"", and ""Venom 3"" can provide some redemption back to Sony."
bmgpppv,2,"""Guys it's just an origin story for Madam Web, just think positive"" NO! Really SUCK, my boyfriend fell asleep 3 times","Well nothing to say. What happened to Jakota Johnson's acting? I think she is the main lead but I don't feel like she's. The whole movie gives me nerves, I don't know why Sony can't handle the superhero movies.If you're hyped for the movie because of the trailer, you will disappoint yourself. The shooting, script and the CGI, ughhhh nothing can save the movie. Even all the actresses can't save it.I am so regretting that I watched this movie in theaters.Lesson learned: never go watch sony's superhero movies again in theaters.Trust me not worth it to go watch at theaters. Just wait for the digital release and don't waste your money and time to go theater."
lew-18-274379,2,Many missing ingredients.,"N an era where superhero narratives dominate the box office, setting expectations sky-high, the latest cinematic venture dares to tread where few have: a superhero movie devoid of superheroes. At first glance, the concept might seem innovative, even groundbreaking-a prequel that promises to lay the groundwork for what could be an epic saga. Yet, upon closer inspection, this audacity falls short of delivering anything remotely heroic or inspiring.The movie's foundational flaw lies in its audacious gamble: to strip away the very essence of what makes superhero tales resonate with audiences worldwide-the heroes themselves. It's akin to staging ""Hamlet"" without the Prince of Denmark; a hollow shell where the core should be. The expectation of witnessing the birth of legends or the rise of unassuming characters to greatness is met with a narrative vacuum. What's left is a prequel to a saga that may never materialize, leaving audiences adrift in a sea of what-ifs and could-have-beens.Moreover, the film's execution exacerbates its conceptual missteps. Instead of using this unique setup to explore rich, untapped veins of character development or world-building, the movie meanders through a disjointed plot, devoid of the compelling stakes or gripping conflicts that define the superhero genre. The absence of heroes not only creates a thematic void but also a disconnect with the audience, who find themselves searching in vain for someone to root for, a beacon of hope or a symbol of resilience.The decision to eschew traditional superhero elements for a more subdued, possibly introspective narrative could have been commendable had it been handled with finesse and depth. Yet, the film falters, failing to engage or evoke the emotional investment typical of its genre. Characters wander through scenes with little purpose, and the narrative seems to stumble blindly towards an anticlimactic conclusion, leaving viewers questioning the purpose of their cinematic journey.This lack of coherence and engagement is further compounded by the film's marketing, which may have set up false expectations. Audiences primed for heroic feats and awe-inspiring battles will find themselves sorely disappointed, as the film offers neither spectacle nor depth. It's a stark reminder that innovation for innovation's sake, without substance or clear direction, can lead to a disjointed experience that neither satisfies nor entertains.In conclusion, while the idea of a superhero movie without superheroes is, in theory, a bold experiment in narrative storytelling, in practice, it falls dramatically short of its potential. It serves as a cautionary tale that even the most intriguing concepts require thoughtful execution and a connection to the audience's expectations. Save your enthusiasm for a project that delivers on its promises. Waiting for this film to debut on streaming services-for free-might be the wisest course of action. In the vast universe of cinematic adventures, this particular entry will likely be remembered not for the risks it took, but for the opportunities it squandered."
bhatnagardeepak-14016,6,Fine one time watch,"There are so many fine watchable movies these days which are shunned by the public. This is one of them. It might not be to everyone's liking but calling it straight bad is not true. For those who want Oscar content from a Marvel movie, keep dreaming till you die. Public should watch movies and then decide rather than influencing others decision. And yes, as people get easily influenced especially because of social media, watchable movies are overlooked by the general public. Spare some time lazy fools. It's better than Black Adam. Action scenes are not bad. Girls look good. Dakota is beautiful and cute. Liked it."
haylodad-18606,1,Worst Than I Imagined,"I really wanted this movie to be good even though every review I read said it was horrible. Movie starts off with terrible acting, loose plot holes, and just downright poor writing. I like Dakota Johnson but she was horrible in this movie. Sydney Sweeney has only been good in Euphoria so I did not expect much from her and yet I still felt disappointed by her acting. This movie was definitely written by AI because I truly doubt someone was paid to write this movie. This movie makes Halle Berry's Cat Woman and George Clooney Batman & Robin look like Infinity War in comparison. I would pay double the money to watch those again than to watch 1 hour of this movie."
destinyarora,9,One of the best of last 3 years movies released.,"Everything is perfect. Hope to see part two soon. It's one of the best movies I've seen of the past 3 years movies released so far. The scenes and all the setting, the script the videography everything was way beyond better than was expect. I've seen many review and the ratings is quite low surprised me. I understand taste can be different for all but the ratings is quite low is what I don't really get. What are viewers expecting beyond this everything according to me is perfectly fine comparing to the many movies that have been released in the past 3 years. I've seen almost all the movies released in the past year and I can certainly says that this one of the best movies I've watched so far in the past 3 years movies released."
nERDbOX_Dave,6,"If you're looking for groundbreaking visuals and mind-bending plots, this might not be your web.","It might not be the most intricately woven superhero flick, but it delivers a dose of nostalgic charm that feels ripped straight from the early 2000s. Think ""Fantastic Four"" with a touch of ""Practical Magic,"" minus the budget for groundbreaking CGI. The story, while predictable, unfolds at a breezy pace, occasionally punctuated by clunky exposition that feels more ""Mystery Men"" than ""The Dark Knight.""If you're looking for groundbreaking visuals and mind-bending plots, this might not be your web. But if you crave a dash of nostalgia, a charming lead performance with the easy on the eyes Dakota Johnson than this will be one to watch on streaming which may age better than Sony's other attempts, in particular ""Venom""."
xpdvgqg,1,This film caused a fight.,"I went to see this with my partner. I expected a bad film, after seeing another all female cast in marvel be gifted with terrible writing and terrible choice of actor/actresses.I'll start with the awful dubbing of the main protagonist making it feel like you are watching a very cheap production. How they felt this was worthy of the cinema is beyond me.Secondly, the script was predictable as in 14 year olds would have been able to predict everything that happened. I laughed a fair bit, but only out of sheer disbelief that this is a movie in 2024.There was the pointless three cpr scenes that was awful to watch. This leads me to my third point. The cringey relationship between the four main characters was so disjointed and awkward and you could feel the main actress could care less about being there. Highly unprofessional considering she will have made more money than the average person will in a lifetime out of this one film.I could go on with more negatives but I'll leave that for other reviews. The best scene of the whole film was the last one. This was the only positive of a truly awful film. And yes, they made a post credit cut scene... which they cut."
fdhvs,1,A Tangled Mess,"Sony proved that you can take Vampires, superpowers,Jared Leto & Jared Harris & still conspire to make a tedious film.Surely they learned their lesson?The answer, is unequivocally no!!!This is not just the worst superhero movie of all time (It makes Quantumania look like Citizen Kane) it's one of the worst movies of all time.The most unforgivable thing is that it's soooo boring!!1hr 54 minutes has NEVER felt so long.Sony / MCU are in serious need of a break & / or reset. Fans are being ripped off in the hope that there's life after Endgame.On this showing, the signs aren't great."
Mon_T,4,"An overly hated, but average, movie.","From the moment the movies trailer came out I felt like I was playing devils advocate when all I could hear was the constant nitpiking and complaints. Madame Web was such a unique concept to todays overly persistant sequal after sequal releases. I also loved the idea of all these Spider-women who've spent years and decades the comics finally being able to grace the Hollywood spotlight.Yet when I was in that cinema I couldn't help but get mixed reactions. There was so much inconsistently, so much telling and explaining more than any showing or action. Pacing was off and situations the characters go through are treated really unrealistically. Don't get me started on the corny dialogue.Although I'm not a ranter who'll join the hate train without acknowledging the things I did find nice. Not phenomenal or spectacular, but nice.The animation isn't that horrible. Sure there were one or two scenes that definetly looked iffy but the rest was pretty good! Good to know that $80 million wasn't entirely wasted.Costuming is very debated but me personally I loved the spider-suits! Bit hesitant when I watched the trailer, however in the movie it sort of grows on you. Not only spider-suits but the overall costuming was pretty good in representing the characters.Camera work had it's cool moments, not all the time, but enough that it kinda snaps your attention back to the screen for a few seconds. However, I never liked how fast it all was, with some scenes it makes sense, but in some scenes it's not nessassary at all.Those three are honestly the only things I can point out. I felt like there was so much potentional for this movie to be greater, and I'm disapointed that this is the first movie to introduce such wonderful comic characters! Sony, you can do so much better if you pay attention to what the public wants!"
mattgamer,1,How do I rate a 0?,"If you're going to spend money to make a film like this, try to engage your audience. Unfortunately the audience they are looking for are themselves. Putting this in theaters was a mistake. It should have went straight to VHS.From the first digital camera zoom, shake, I could tell the quality of this video was subpar with no knowledge of cinema. If the producers watched just one Alfred Hitchcock film, they would have dozens if not thousands of ways to set up a scene.Now I will recommend films worth your time: The 39 Steps (1939), Rebecca (1940), Strangers on a Train (1951) and North by Northwest (1959). All are exceptional stories and productions, sadly Madame Web did not even try."
Masseh62,1,Worse than you can imagine,"Think of the worst movie you have seen. Then multiply it by infinity. That will come closely to this movie. Even then, this movie is worse...
From the advertisements, I knew this movie wasn't going to be great but still, it surprised me how bad and boring it was. Everything about the direction, writing, characters, technical aspects, and designs are really awful. The writing is poor as there are many concepts, ideas and aspects that are messy and bland. The messy script creates poor dialogue from the cast and the characters are not interesting. The special effects looked even worse than the marketing and all of the performances were pretty bad. I honestly do feel bad for Dakota Johnson cause she is a good actress but she deserves to have better roles then this. It can be said for the same for the rest of the cast members.The uses of product placements are annoying, action moments are dull, and and all in all, it was boring. Superhero movies shouldn't be boring but this really dragged on.."
TheTexasChainstoreManager,2,Congratulations Marvel! You've reached a new low!,"Did you ever wonder what the result would be if a bunch of middle school kids were handed 80 million dollars (+20 mil marketing) to make a movie? They would write the script themselves, hire and direct some reasonably big actors. Well, this would be the result.When people normally write something snarky like i did now, they're exaggeration. I'm not. This is all i could think of when i watched Madame Web. ""Is this a middle school project? What is this dialogue? What are they doing? Why are they doing this? Who speaks like this? That's not how things work.""Considering all the bad decisions and the trajectory of of all Marvel projects, especially after ""Avengers: Endgame"", i knew this would be bad. But Madame Web actually managed to reach another level of awful.First off, i feel sorry for the actors. If the movie actually was written and directed by kids, they would've probably enjoyed the process. But eligibly only adults - who's just horrible at what they do - were involved in the writing and directing and they should all have their movie making licenses revoked. The actors can't hide the pain and shame over the dumb and nonsensical things they have to say and do and especially Dakota Johnson and Emma Roberts probably handled this gig like being paid decently for doing an enema. Johnson even said that the movie didn't turn out like she thought it would and that she never would return to the superhero world again.Oh well. Marvel, Sony and Columbia Pictures, Disney, whatever, are obviously hellbent on burning money on horrible movies and tv-shows, made by horrible writers and directors, and i'm not gonna stop them. Let them crash. They deserve it."
brainwerx-1,6,"not great, but not bad","Ok, the movie is a bit of a mess. It isn't all that great... The writing is predictable, but overall, it's not as bad as some of the reviews would have you think. I can't help thinking that the writers just didn't get the concept. The 4 main characters were good, and you were able to see where they were coming from and where they were going. It was a messy ride though.To be fair, I was never a fan of the Madame Web character, if in the graphic novels/comics. But, I thought I would give it a go, since I never want to believe really bad reviews, as I always think that (especially where there are female leads) the reviewers have issues with female heroes. As I said, is it great? No. Is it worth a look? Yes. Just understand that it is a good concept, but it could have been better."
kevinfaftine,2,This movie is a Masterpiece 10/10,"Except for the villain, like he's so terribly written, not ever written, cuz he was underwritten. 9/10.Talking about the villain, why did it look and sound like his voice was dubbed over, his mouth was doing something and the words didn't even match. Ok 8/10.But Jesus, the editing. I've seen YouTube videos with better editing, felt like everything was happening at the same time, but nothing was happening. Let's just give it a 7/10.Man, that script though, even a movie no matter how bad it is, I almost never end it thinking I can do a better job, but I 100% think I could write a better script. Why is Cassandra Webb so unlikable? It's poorly established that she hates her mom, but when she goes to Peru, all of a sudden she forgives her? We suppose to feel something? And when did her character go from ""I will send you to your parents they can't take care of you"" to ""They are family, they are my daughters"". Jesus, ok 6/10 final score.She's also never once addressed as ""Madame"" in the whole movie, waste of title. 5/10.The future where they are wearing the suits looks way more interesting, I would've rather watched that movie. 4/10 for false advertisement, making us believe those suits would have been in the movie way more.WAIT!!! What do you mean the iconic line ""He was in the Amazon with my mom when she was researching spiders just before she died"" ISN'T EVEN IN THE MOVIE... DAMN THIS MOVIE 0/10.Alright 1/10 cuz the ending was kinda cute in a cheesy way."
saimariejohnson,9,"Maternal, Divine Feminine Lovers Will Appreciate.","I really enjoyed Madame Web and hope to see her spiderling saga continue. It was interesting to see a new, and far more intuitive superhero and one who foster children and those who have lost a parent young can relate to. Madame Web is a unique glimpse into a Maternal instinct-driven character who embodies female empowerment and leans into an extrasensory perception that otherwise might be dismissed. It seems like a fragile ability that can only do so much. Still, when Cassie begins to connect with her inner self and revelations about pain and ancestral trauma are laid to rest she becomes a fierce opponent and carries through to shine brilliantly as a victorious, protective powerhouse with a soft and golden heart."
ronitsriv,7,Has it's sloppy moments but worth a watch on OTT,"Ok, first of all watch the movie for the story. Don't think that there will be mind blowing action scenes every few minutes. This is not a kids cartoon.I didn't have any expectations from this film. I wouldn't have been surprised if every scene of it cringed me out.But it delivers for the most part. The first half just kept me hooked.For me it was like a good movie with some sloppy moments. I do find some things really conveniently happening for the sake of the story.For example having access to all the cameras in the world? Too far fetched even for a Science fiction movie.If a little work would have been done on refining few plot lines and few scenes this movie would have been great.No complaints with the animation really.Maybe it was a problem for others but a few sloppy parts didn't ruin the experience for me. I enjoyed watching it.It is certainly much better than what the critics say."
sreejeshchakkaran,1,Incredible CGI or CGM ðŸ¤”,I sincerely think this movie has no human touch to its script. Hopefully disney didn't fire all its script writers and subscribed to chatgpt to produce this lackluster robotic script. We need human brains at work to produce valuable content. The movie felt like random acts of CGI mixed with noise and incredible sound. No wonder indian movies are gaining popularity in recent times as they do not have a budget for computer generated scripts (CGS) and heavily rely on human intelligence for script and screenplay. I think this is a phase where hollywood is trying to make the shift from human generated movies to a computer generated movie (CGM).
scottgmckenzie-23274,1,Why? & just not any good!,"Madam Web attempts to delve into the Spiderverse but fails to deliver due to its lackluster action scenes lack of character journey and subpar CGI. From the outset, it's evident that the film struggles to find its footing, relying too heavily on flashy visuals to compensate for its hollow narrative and sucky characters.The action sequences, meant to inject excitement into the film, fall flat, lacking both creativity and coherence. Instead of drawing viewers into the heart of the conflict, they serve only to highlight the film's reliance on tired tropes and uninspired choreography.Furthermore, the CGI, touted as cutting-edge, fails to impress, with poorly-rendered effects detracting from rather than enhancing the viewing experience. From laughably fake explosions to painfully obvious green screen work, the film's visual effects only serve to underscore its overall lack of quality.The pacing exacerbates these issues, with action set pieces shoehorned in at the expense of character development and plot coherence. Rather than serving as climactic moments, these scenes feel forced and contrived, leaving audiences disengaged and uninvested in the outcome.Additionally, the film's heavy-handed symbolism only serves to highlight its narrative shortcomings, with clumsy metaphors doing little to elevate the shallow characterizations and lackluster dialogue.By the time the credits roll, Madam Web leaves viewers feeling more frustrated than fulfilled, a prime example of style over substance in modern cinema. In the end, it's a forgettable entry into the genre, offering little in the way of entertainment or insight."
radubecheanu,1,BAD THIS IS SO SO SO BAD,"Lease consider using your time more effectively, and burn down any movie theatres that showcase this monstrousity, i would be eternally greatful. Madame Web is god awful! Very difficult to sit through. None of the main characters are likeable. Even the villain is lame. It seems like the entire movie was written to set up a sequel. But why would people spend money to see the sequel of a movie that is one of the worst movies ever written? I'm shocked at how bad this movie is and if there is a sequel I certainly wont bother watching it. Horrible from beginning to end, the opening scene just reeks of awful predictability from story & plot to the core. You know exactly what will happen before it even happens, the script sucks & the dialogue is even worse.Stop hiring bad writers, Hollywood!"

ernestobladins,1,Netflix or Marvel Studios need to take Spider-man IP away from sony forcefully,"It is clear that Sony won't listen. From this point forward i want any live action spin off movie that disney releases to flop hard. Kraven, El muerto, Venom 3, The sinister 6 they hope to build, all of them i want them to flop massively and i want this company to go bankrupt. I resent this company for making this garbage.We need to teach them that no matter how low the budget is they will still lose money. It is something personal now. Sony is only making this garbage movies to keep the rights to spider-man. It's an a middle finger to the fans, and insult to cinema, and the stock holders should at least demand that all the producers, directors and writers involved in these movies get fire for good and never get hired again.Some people ask for the amazing spider-man 3 with andrew to be made, and i'm just like really? By this studio? It would be awful.The movie is badly edited, with bad dialogues, bad story, bad villain, who despite having spider-man powers cannot even do anything significant against simple fragile female teenagers who don't have any powers for 99% of the movie. It's bad, really bad. The marvels looks very decent compared to this."
kitlee-69506,1,Horrible movie that no one ask for or want,"I don't understand why it is so difficult to make a great superhero movies these days. They did it with the Avengers era. Surely you just follow the formula and repeat.You know your audience demographic, you have a loyal fan base, wealth of already written comic book stories but you the studios still fail to make something resembling watchable.I don't understand the model of pandering to the few people who wants certain genders or ideologies. It doesn't work and never has done. People like that they like and that doesn't change no matter how much you ram down their thoughts. I guess making money and making shareholders happy doesn't matter these days.Please avoid at all costs."
ngobissnetwork,7,I enjoyed this film,"Why is everyone giving this film a bad rating? I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Even though it's not very good, at least it doesn't make me sleepy watching it. Even though these kids act like kids who have just graduated from acting school, in general it's enough for me to enjoy. Big budget and pretty good animation. I don't think it's appropriate for a film this good to be equated with a low caste film.Then I don't think the story is too predictable. At first it was quite confusing to connect one event to another. Oh, it turns out that at the beginning it was his mother's story. And the film focuses on her daughter saving the three teenagers. Only in the middle of the film do we understand why the three teenage girls were saved. Good flow. Not boring."
Jithindurden,4,Bad and stupid but a little bit charming,"The film is set in 2003 and it is shot like it is a TV pilot from that time too. Everything in it is so half-baked that it is really unbelievable that this is such a huge studio film. At the same time, for this exact reason, and maybe because even bad superhero movies are still comfort films for me, there was some charm to it. The simplicity with which a lot of it is approached, and the lack of real stakes really made this a very comfortable watch. It is still a bad film but I really didn't think it was one of the worst superhero movies. The last superhero movie I saw at the theater, Aquaman 2 was definitely worse than this in my opinion.And I think the casting was done a long time ago because watching Syndey Sweeny as a meek-mannered teenager supporting character feels very weird when she's basically established as the new hot star in Hollywood."
whitfin_,7,"A bit different, better than it says","Way better than Venom and Morbius. Not very superhero-y though if you're wanting just a female Spider-Man type character.Dakota Johnson was great, the others were fine. Not sure why so many reviews are talking about Sweeney and hating on Johnson (although I'm sure you can guess).Some decent jokes, the usual cringe with these movies, and some weird audio de-sync? Had a horror-esque theme that was pretty good for the first hour or so. The villain sucked but let's be honest every villain has sucked aside from Thanos in recent memory.Nothing amazing, but definitely better than the 3/10 iMDB gave it within a day of release, go figure."
ForeNikeGolf,1,So Bad,"I really didn't want this to be bad. I know the world has grown sick of the MCU. I've been there since the first Avengers movie but I love the Spider-Man animated-verse series and am a Dakota fan, so I was hopeful the bad reviews were MCU hangover-related. Welp, the reviews are right. This movie is downright painful. The opening sequence felt a little like the opening to Jurassic Park or Raiders of the Lost Ark which was a good start. But dang it just kept getting worse and worse as the story unfolded. I don't even know what else to say other than please save yourself the time and don't bother with this movie. There are no redeeming qualities."
RikuVAnueva,5,This was a missed potential product.,"Like the title says.Madame Web is a weird experience to have as a film student, and extra so as a fan of Spider-Man.The editing is really weird in the beginning, the script is kinda meh and leans hard into serendipity for it's later moments, the Spidey lore is changed for the sake of.... I don't even really know (but it's not horrible), the VFX in some scenes is really off, it's just.... a large product of ""whatever"" soup when it could've at least been a pretty decent broccoli cheddar pasta bowl.That all said, this could've been significantly worse.Like, yeah, I have criticisms. But also, if a DIE HARD Spidey fan like me can say ""yeah, it's fine."" then it's really not that bad. (Also, from the perspective of someone who studies and works in film production, this is a decent movie; people who don't know d!ck about Spidey lore outside of the movies aren't really gonna complain, it's just a middling experience.)"
rdietman,2,"Just lazy, awful movie","Spoiler: This movie is just bad.First, can we stop pretending that Dakota Johnson has ANY acting skills. She must have made some kind of deal for starring in the fifty shades of awful movies.Her emotionless, wooden performance is only one problem with this mess of a movie. The countless plot holes, awful dubbing, and just ridiculous premise far overshadow Johnson's incompetence.How did a woman driving around in a stolen taxi for weeks on end (they have trackers), wanted for abducting three teen girls and assaulting several cops just catch a quick flight to and from Peru? And then when she gets back a week later, still have the same stolen taxi?When in Peru, she just wanders into the woods with a drawing and finds the lost tribe without even breaking a sweat.The villian looked like he wasn't even moving his lips when he talked, and the cost was just laughable.If you're looking for a completely ridiculous movie to laugh at, this one will fit the bill."
wbrown-04128,2,With great powers -should not be abused,"Poor story telling, not even a good story. No cohesion of characters. Messy plot, corny filming ie jimmy jib camera on crane moving in and the swirling around subject. Too repetitive. Madam Web was not even a good comic book character, so why create something out of nothing? Also why foes the bad guys costume look so similar to the one out of The Inhumans series? Another annoying aspect is the incessant background music track that eas obviously not scored to match the on screen action. It is good to have space in the audio. It is not necessary to have constant musack in the background. And where were Ben and Aunt may? Where and why were thrir characters necessary? There have not been many films that after 25 minutes. I really couldn't be bothered to watch, but this was one of them. As a true believer, I watched to the end!!! Such a waste."
ccalderon-09873,1,Netflix did me Dirty,"In the few moments cherished with my husband and two cats, we thought we would sit and enjoy an average B-Listed movie...it was anything but that. The only joy sparred is the slight grin and curiosity I had reviewing others critiques, feeling compelled to write my own. I feel for Dakota, the cast, and hours of work the entire production crew invested to help start, jump start or resurrect their career in Hollywood. I'm a patron of the arts so I get it. The executives, producers and financiers who butchered, modified and rescripted the original manuscript ought to be tared/feathered and publicly admonished. It was a film that was everywhere and no where, all at once...spirituality, capitalism, nativism, social commentary and bacanality of special effects wrapped into a breathless 120min plot... you've been warned."
yanez_ay-54508,2,Is not too bad...But,"The movie was ok not great and not bad. There's too much talking and not enough story or character development. However, the story is entertaining enough. Dakota Johnson is just a terrible actress, I repeat terrible. She shows zero emotion throughout the whole movie. I wish they would've chosen a different lead actress. She seems bored which made it hard to get into. The other actors were great. The three younger actresses would've made a better solo movie. They carried this movie. There is also not enough action for an action film. They could've done so much with this film. Only watch it if there's nothing left to watch."
Klaus24,6,Was expecting way worse...,"This movie lacks passion and a good pace. It's too long and it tells no story. Some little things are good, some sidestories, but overall it's just pointless.I saw this just for Sydney Sweeeney, and I can say she's the only one who at least made some effort in acting, who believe a bit in this movie, and I'm glad she recoverde so quickly after it (SNL). The other actors are just wandering and mumbling in a story that could have been told better, it had some possibilities and one or two interesting characters (at least in the future). And please, the next time you're gonna cast Syd in a superhero movie, don't make her ugly: not only they tried to do so in this movie, but they even failed at it. Let her be herself, thank Mother Nature for her incredible shape and act accordingly!I believe, all things considered, this is not the worst flop compared to other superhero movies recently released (betweeen 2023 and 2024), but surely one of the most painfully and foolishly missed opportunities. They had some potential, but still lost: such a shame!This movie deserved a 3.5/10, but recently I saw something even worse that made me kind of want to see Madame Web so I improved the rating for it. The (average) performance from Syd made me adjust it a little higher, so this is why the final vote 6/10 came from."
bradberrybilly,1,Worst movie yet,Can confidently say this is the worse movie anyone will lay their eyes for generations to come. The plot is atrocious easily predictable like it was written by an actual child. It's like if you told ChatGPT to churn out a stereotypical movie but make it in the lowest quality. This ruined my day thank you maybe even possibly my week. The music is trash the actors are terrible they can't make one scene seem unscripted. It's like the studio had to hit a quota for the year and picked this garbage out of a hat. My dog could write a better script than this. Should've put this money into a movie people would actually like.
rcmcglasson,10,Citizen Kane meets The Godfather,"This movie is acclaimed Director S. J. Clarkson's magnum opus. Most Marvel movies are exclusive to AppleTV. But Tim Cook understood that Netflix has a larger subscriber base and didn't want the world to be deprived of watching this masterpiece, so he allowed Netflix to carry it. And humanity appreciates this generosity. I can honestly say I strive to be a better person after the Madame Web experience.The plot seems inane on the surface, but after 16 bong hits I realized it's genius. The dialogue is brilliant, the character development goes so deep I feel like they represent the best and worst of all of us. Most nights I find myself falling to sleep contemplating the message this movie is telling us. Some nights I laugh, other nights I cry..."
meghaas92,6,Give it a chance! I actually enjoyed it!,"Maybe it's because I like Dakota Johnson and Adam Scott, but I actually kind of enjoyed the movie. I was excited to see it when I heard that it was a superhero movie and it had some actors I really like it but then people were saying how bad it was. That it was actually the worst movie they had seen in a long time, I disagree. But I will admit they did totally dub over the villains voice where his lips don't match up with what he's saying through most of the movie. But I knew that going in to it so it didn't bother me as much whenever I watched it. I felt like it had a really good storyline. It kept me entertained through the entire thing and the editing, besides the dubbed over villains voice, was typical marvel. I'm glad I decided to watch it even though people were ragging on it so hard. I would watch it again and I would recommend it to anyone else who likes a decent superhero movie, but I will warn them about the villains voice."
Persora,5,A terrible film that made me laugh throughout,"Let's be clear this film is utter rubbish from beginning to end. The acting is atrocious but the script is so bad you almost want to forgive the actors for their horrendous delivery. If I was told it had been written by an AI or by a child I would almost be relieved.It's visually ugly as well. The special effects and the cinematography are abysmal.I watched it over 3 nights which I think helped digest the mess. But I have to be honest, I laughed non stop and was deeply entertained by the whole thing. When I thought it couldn't be worse, it hit even harder. So I am giving a higher rating than it deserves purely for the ""so bad it's good"" entertainment factor it provided.Otherwise as an actual film it deserves a 2 at most."
roccojosephleone,4,Cant watch sober,"I was super high watching this movie and that made it a lot more enjoyable. But even then it's sooo agaonizing at some points. An hour in i thought time was going by prettty quickly, then the next half felt sooo long. Like I became sober and my enjoyment depleted. Parts are so forced that it's genuinely funny to the point where I don't know if the comedic elements are well written. So the strengths would be in the character interactions between the main female characters. Everything else could be better. The antagonists voice is so goofy. I don't remember the plot, and some of the expositional dialogue had no direction behind it.There was this one part where I genuinely laughed super hard. I forget the context, they just saved someone's life and Dakata Johnson's character says ""You did it"" like how a mother would tell her child after scoring a goal in soccer. I don't know if that was intentional but the delivery from Dakota Johnson there was absolutely brilliant."
linaignatova,1,"Just bad, but really, really bad!","I'll admit I don't like Dakota Johnson at all. To me, her acting is flat, fake and unprofessional. However, I'm always willing to give her a chance to change my mind. This time, however, I don't think the fault for this fiasco is entirely hers. I really need to know who are the people responsible who made the decision to make this movie. From the script, to the direction, to the acting, to even the special effects, this movie is a complete failure and I have no idea what could save it.Feel free to skip the movie, you won't lose anything!But if you decide to watch it, please share your impressions."
Dark_Kunzite,4,INCREDIBLE MOVIE! MADE ME CRY! TANSCENDED ME TO ANOTHER PLANE OF EXISTANCE!,"When I saw this movie, I cried. Never had I seen such beauty before. The story was immaculate and made me feel like I was in the world. I could see myself with a can of Pepsi while watching a paramedic teach about CPR.All the characters in this movie BLEW ME AWAY! The villain's design was SO ORIGINAL! What a wonderful cast of characters, but especially the well fleshed out villain. The plot twist that he was in the Amazon with Madame's mom when she was researching spiders right before she died was INCREDIBLE! I would have NEVER seen that coming. MIND BLOWN!The acting was full of emotion. You could feel everything the characters were feeling in this masterpiece. My emotions were in sync with theirs; when they cried, I cried; when they laughed, I laughed, too; when they tried to do CPR, I joined them.The animation in this looks AWESOME! It looks vaguely life like, which works for the live-action human characters. It's quite ambitious to mix animation with live action, especially when the animation is the ENTIRE SETTING! SO SURREAL! And that cat? Beautiful! You could see they were going for real life, but kept it stylized where you could tell it wasn't real.The directing and editing was phenomenal. Its constant cutting away to leave you no time to process what's going on makes you FEEL LIKE YOU ARE IN THE FIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CONFUUUUUUSSSSSSEEEEEDDDDD. WOWIE! ZOOOOOOOMMMMMMM! I LOVE TOXIC SO MUCH!Finally, the writing made me transcend to a dimension beyond our plane of existence... it showed me the true meaning of life... W E B. When Madame left the teenagers alone in the forest when she knew they were in danger was PEAK WRITING! The dialogue MADE ME FEEL LIKE I COULD MORB OUT!(Seriously though, I'm comparing this movie to stuff like Dingo Pictures, so at least it's better than rip off Disney movies... but not by much... but at least it was fun :P)"
logansgotmail,1,"Not even ""fun to watch"" bad.","Genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Can't think of any redeeming qualities about it. There is a way to make this a decent-ish movie and the fact that the screen writer or script writers couldn't fall into it is a massive indictment on who they are. Don't waste your time, it isn't even funny bad, just exhausting. Everything is predictable, the camera work is disorienting and distracting, the villain lacks any sense of threat or real motivation, and the main characters are just a pile of cliches thrown together tossing out one liners before they start a sequence of poorly choreographed chase scenes."
svenh-43579,2,WTH is this?!,"This film proves once again that Sony's glory days are over.I think everyone now agrees that this is a great story about a character from the Marvel universe and everyone wanted to see this film just because of that.But I think everyone was disappointed.The biggest problem with the film itself is our civilization itself, the image of women.The film tried to show strong and proactive women working together as a team, going beyond their limits to build a foundation.But instead of making this realistic and not too theatrical, Sony once again managed to make things worse. This fake power woman image, which simply seems too exaggerated and far from reality, triggers a feeling of shame when you look at it, which is almost unbearable.This story could have become something very exciting, but I think the spider has been shot."
popularmovielover,7,Entertaining movie,It's no Endgame or Infinity War but fun to watch and has a couple of Easter eggs. Unfortunately no mid or end credits scene. I guess they want to keep it open whether it should be associated withTom Holland's Spider-Man. Would love for it to be part of the 616 Marvel Cinematic Universe but a lot of people really really hate it as can be seen by the rating and numerous negative reviews. Don't understand why there is so much hate. My guess is it's got the same reason that men are upset women choose the bear. They don't like powerful and independent women. Probably threatens their small male ego.
bradleybutin,2,FANDEMICALLY REVIEW'd,"I heard that Madame Web was bad, but I just had to see it for myself. The critics and everyone else that said it was bad, got it right this time. The film starts out in 1973 with the mom in Peru, looking for a spider as she is VERY pregnant, so she can hopefully find a spider that can save her baby's life after the doctors told her that she won't live long after being born. She is betrayed & killed by the villain of the movie. (I'll get to him in a second) & takes the spider that she needs to save her baby's life. Then the mysterious spider people of Peru attempt to save her, but do save the baby.Fast forward to 2003, where the majority of the music they play in the movie is from the 90's. Cassandra Web all grown up in the foster care system. We don't know how she made it back to America, did she have a father that could take her after her mom died, or uncle or an aunt? Cassie became a paramedic, and her & her partner get this.... HATE PEOPLE. Yes, paramedics that don't know what to do when a women's water breaks. Cassie has a near death experience, and then starts to see the future, in a lot of really bad editing. She can't stop her boss (Mike Epps) from dying, but then decides to save 3 girls that all have a connection with. That someone is trying to kill because in the future they are going to kill him. This happens in guess what??? A train. Yes, there is a Train wreck in this Train wreck of a movie.Tarantula, is the bad guy and the guy that killed Cassie's mom 30 years prior.He is apparently cursed because he took the spider, that he built a shrine for in his home. We don't know anything about the curse, but it's there. He has some tech genius as his little hacker girl for some unknown reason, and the voiceover for him was beyond terrible.Let's talk about the script, the writing was bad, at times even cringy. The story just didn't work. The cuts in the editing was HORRID. Especially in the action sequences.By far the best part of the movie, is the Fantastic 4 spider girls! You got Madame Web, Spider-Woman, Spider-Woman, & Spider-Girl. They did the best they could! They did what they could to shine up this POS of a movie.I will be trying to fix this movie on my podcast... Very soon."
olliwrld,9,"Swimming against the current, cause this movie wasn't bad at all","This movie was an absolute blast and all of the cinema's guests had a great time.I find myself at odds with the negative reviews and it baffles me how superhero movies and series have to go through such a rough time being subjected to such stringent scrutiny. It appears that the expectation now is for each release to outdo 'Endgame', forsaking the charm of simpler narratives that could eventually and beautifully build up to another grand showdown.Nevertheless, I'd like to preempt any hasty and unjustly judgments about my review, as my views here are candid, shaped by my practice of not perusing reviews beforehand. This approach ensures that my perspectives aren't skewed by prevalent points of criticisms, that the collective gaze would not have noticed on their own:Dakota Johnson delivered an impeccable performance as the lead character. I loved Cassandra's sense of humor, the way she navigates the journey of understanding and handling her powers and her depth of empathy despite her solitary nature.Spider-Man's Spider-Sense has always been a hallmark of his abilities. Madame Web magnifies this aspect and places a stronger emphasis on this ability, rather than showcasing the more familiar scenes of web-shooting, web-swinging, and wall-crawling.We got some kind of evil Spider-Man (!) enriched by motives that were clear and comprehensible.The dialogue struck a perfect balance, weaving humor throughout without veering into outright comedy. It was cleverly scripted to amuse without detracting from the film's overall tone.All the outfits and costumes were top-notch, each piece contributing to the visual feast this movie presented.In light of Sydney Sweeney's performance, I found her portrayal profoundly fitting to her character's essence, her acting was nothing less than stellar, debunking any premature judgments.I'm eagerly anticipating the return of these characters and am thrilled at the prospect of crossover moments among Sony's Marvel lineup. Picture a dynamic alliance involving Venom, Madame Web's ensemble, Kraven and Andrew Garfield's Amazing Spider-Man, all joining forces to take on the multiverse hopping Inheritors. Additionally, the vampiric nature of the Inheritors paves the way for connections to Morbius. This matchup is intriguing, especially with the potential multiverse interactions originating from the Sony Spider-Man Universe."
magaffiraf,6,Sometimes settle is enough!!,"Besides picking a different actor for the villain, (he was trash) this movie actually seems like a decent origin story ,without all the bluster of explosions and mass stunts .Seeing what a sequel would look like at the end of the movie makes it actually a decent movie. I hate how the community of comic book movie lovers and the critics always take a dump on everything because it's not Infinity War or Endgame. This is a legitimate story that adds depth to Spider-Mans powers origin, and the fact that his powers aren't random...it may not be dressed up the way you like it or want it, but it has merit."

andydavis-19959,1,An abysmal failure to entertain,"This movie fails on every metric of consideration. The plot has more holes than swiss cheese and too many grotesque, lazy shortcuts were taken in the writing to create any semblance of believability. As a result, it's impossible to feel invested in the characters and story.The CGI was mediocre, at best. The characters were superficial. The dialogue was cheese. The story was confusing and felt aimless. Usually a superhero origins story answers viewer's questions; but Madame Web only succeeded in repeatedly causing ""WTF?!?"" sentiments.I have to wonder what sort of delusional group-think bubble existed when this movie was planned and made. How could those involved not grasp the dirge they were creating?This is, for me, the worst movie ever released under the Marvel banner. I hope they feel discouraged to make a sequel."
leary-paul,1,Nonsensical babble,Nonsensical babble. Believe the bad reviews. Don't watch it. It makes no sense whatsoever. You could spend your time doing anything else than this. Stay far far away from this movie. This movie should be an erased from the universe. I can't believe the editors allowed this movie to go forward. I can't believe the director thought these are good choices. I can't believe the actors thought this is something I wanna do. I can't believe they made this movie. Don't watch this movie because you will be disappointed as is everybody who has watched it. It's making me angry it's so bad. Your don't let people get away with making movies like this.
zigc-56767,1,Sony - hand the keys back to Marvel now please.,"What a mess of a movie - I often wonder when it is that the actors involved in these kind of car crashes realise what they've actually signed up for. Muddled plot, complete misunderstanding of the original source materials. This would/t even be ok as a saturday morning kids TV show.And it's now one of several stinkers that Sony have managed to push our way. Admittedly the animated Spiderman movies have been fabulous, and I enjoyed the Venom movies (cheesey as they were), but this and things like Morbius show Sony's inability to do anything useful with the Spiderman universe characters. Maybe kraven will turn that around - I hope so... but am fearing the worst.Avoid."
InTruderTellsTruth,4,Mehh!,"Waste of time and patience. CGI was pathetic. I don't know why it's even compared to Morbius, i liked that a lot.But Madam Webb - Sorry to say, the story was very dramatic and irrelevant.They just created a professor x of spider heroes.The only positive thing I liked was a dialogue: With great responsibility, comes great powers.That sounded cool, and gave a hope that how this might be useful in forging spider superheroes. We might see a link with Uncle Ben's Peter Parker, or might even see a post credit scene of potential upcoming future. But nahhh! None of it happened. This is just a dumb movie with no future. Period!"
linotheundead,2,2 stars because 2.5 wasn't possible,"Ok, I just finished watching this and look, it's pretty ordinary but I don't think I can agree with the people saying it's ""tHe WoRsT mOvIe EvEr"" - that particular title still belongs (and I suspect shall forever) to the absolutely woeful Skinamarink.The pacing is all over the shop, there are multiple plot developments and character decisions that are just plain nonsensical, the editing is subpar in places, the dialogue in general is just really corny...
But the worst part by far is the shocking ADR job on the villain's voice. I was convinced at first that his voice was completely replaced by another actor but after watching a few interviews it's definitely him, it's just soo poorly done that it's jarring.All that being said there's absolutely no reason to blame the actors for any of this. They did their best with what they were given, and I'm fairly certain when filming wrapped they all sat around laughing about it and saying ""Doesn't matter, got paid!""Overall I actually think it's sorta good that this film exists, if only as a cautionary tale to Sony, and all production companies, as an example of how NOT to approach filmmaking.Now, does that mean you should watch it? Absolutely not, hahaha.Oh, and if you do subject yourself to it, there's no after credit scene."
carinnalowther,6,Strange,I actually really enjoyed the first 30min. Main character has personality and an interesting backstory.When the 3 girls entered things felt very different. Then she's like moming them. But then all of a sudden she is in the jungle. And there is a jungle guru. Weird time travel vision quest.Very confusing and jumbled. Wish the who movie was like the first half hour.Alot of the graphics were really interesting.Are we implying that spiderman got his costume design from these jungle people without the jungle people existing?Is the Spider-Man spider a decent of this Amazon spider?Much more questions then answers.
kasprozx,3,New watch,"Too fast paced could be longer start 7/10 climax 4/10 ending 3/10 needs to do better just my opinion.Madame Web, a complex and enigmatic character in the Marvel universe, is a mutant with extraordinary psychic abilities. As a paralyzed, blind, telepathic, and clairvoyant individual, she serves as a mentor to various Spider-Women, guiding them through their heroic journeys. Madame Web's powers allow her to see into the future, read minds, and project her astral form, making her a formidable force in the world of superheroes.In the 2024 film ""Madame Web,"" the character is portrayed as a clairvoyant deeply connected to the spider world. The storyline follows her as she mentors a young woman destined to become the next Spider-Woman, delving into a dark and mysterious realm. Despite the film's negative reception, Madame Web remains a pivotal figure in the Spider-Man universe, with her psychic prowess and ties to the Spider-Women adding depth and intrigue to Marvel's superhero tapestry."
bincysara-60188,9,I loved it,"I was deciding whether to watch the movie in the theater seeing the reviews, jeez.. I'm so glad I decided to ignore and give it a shot. I thoroughly enjoyed the film Dakota Johnson acting was brilliant ,to be honest I didn't really expect that because seeing the trailer I thought she didn't feel like a superhero.. well I was wrong . I loved the fact that it was not a typical superhero film , a superheroine struggling and making it to the other end supporting her 3 fellow teenagers. I felt the portrayal of feminism was beautifully shown , how they supported each other unlike the messy ms marvel movie . I also loved the sequence of how she sees the future and then going back to the present. The train scene was my favorite. The antagonist also did a good job playing the villain role. I loved how simple the movie was , the whole sequence was very nicely shown. I would definitely watch it again. Just sit back and enjoy if you are a person who wants exact as the comic book then this isn't for you . But if you are a person who enjoys a simplicity of a movie done well not over the top just perfect . Then I would say ignore the reviews and do watch it. Worth it!"
joelwillems,7,"Teases excitement, just doesn't deliver","This would be a fine film, if it was the third or fourth installment in the series. This is just not the way to set up an extended universe. Hopefully it is a study by film students and current writers / directors alike.They tried an Iron Man story with his origin to go in chronological order. Difference was, Iron Many had a very charismatic hero and some dangerous villains along with a lot more, she we say, firepower. Even with the firepower in the final battle, this did not deliver on that. There were some entertaining chase sequences but, I don't believe I'm going to say this, too little of the character development. We learned more about Cassie and her partner's life than the three sidekicks.It can't be the run time either. Another five or ten minutes added to some character development all around, except for more time on Cassie's partner and her cat, and this could have been much better and tighter. Obviously have to blame the director but also the writer and editor. Too bad we'll never see more of these actors in these roles. I suppose they could do an animated series but that's so 1980s."
terrylarosa,1,Even worse than envisioned,"Thankfully we decided not to see it in the theatre. This was terrible. Only CBM that are worse are The Spirit and Joker. Obviously no medical advisor was used. Having a BP of 79/59 and an O2 sat of 89 means your vitals are not anywhere near stable. You're also not stable after being resurrected like she said about that guy she was doing CPR on. It has literally one action sequence and that's the climax; which was poorly executed containing one of the most laughable scenes ever witnessed. When're ambulance comes rocketing through a building, falling 20 feet ( totally unscathed ) and manages to perfectly hit the villain and nothing else. As for that villain. Totally not menacing and instead of just snapping their neck he continues to just throw them around. Thankfully after deservedly doing badly at the B. O. we will never have to see a sequel with these potentially awful 3 superheroines. That's 2 back to back disaster movies for women superheroes ( The Marvels was almost as bad ). They need to do better jobs ( aka the excellent Wonder Woman ). This was the utter pits. Finally I was waiting for them to name the baby Peter but nope, didn't even get that. Such poor filmmaking for a big budget movie."
PANDIAN120621,3,"The future hasn't happened yet for ""MADAME WEB""...!!!","Madame web must have been written by an ardent teenager who happens to be a fan of MARVELS...
The narrative of the story doesn't make sense, the sequence, NONE IF IT WORKS!!!Just driving around in a stolen cab around town and to the airport, the sudden trip to Peru. And the perfect timing of her return to fend off the bad guy, it's just so so bad. It's really unbelievable how bad the writing really is, and then the cringey acting on top of it all is just so disappointing. Hopefully all the criticism will help those who need the change in Hollywood. Because this movie is TRASH! It will go down as the worst superhero movie of all time. Absolutely disgraceful...The storyline, if it can be called that, revolves around a man haunted by a dream, leading to a nonsensical chase, a premise that lacks both originality and coherence...Overall Madame Web is a film that might be worth a watch when it's available at no cost but even then be warned that it's two hours you won't get back..."
NadiaMRobertson,3,MADAME WEB - The Art of Detachment,"MADAME WEB is neither a top tier nor trash, but definitely a mid effort entry into the Spider-Man franchise where its interesting character concepts get overshadowed by its inconsistent execution and sloppy storytelling. A blending of The Terminator / Looper meets The Dead Zone & Final Destination (at one point she even tailgates an 18 wheeler log truck), there's an interesting mix of time bending tropes threaded throughout, and even a few moments worthy of LOLing (""Am I on the right train now?"") still manage to find their way into the unevenly attempted psychological thriller tone to give it some genuine laughs. It's not always a pretty picture and a little painful to look at trying to process its sometimes questionable creative choices. At times the consistent, snappy zooming ins and outs camerawork and quick cut editing is reminiscent of the worst visual elements of Reality TV and reflective of the lackluster look of network shows that sub these tired tactics in lieu of some kind of artistic vision. Thankfully the atrocious assault to the eyes is not consistent and actually becomes better for chunks of the film to the point of questioning if two totally different people had their hands in the aesthetic decision making.Dakota Johnson by nature of Cassie Web is actually an apt casting choice given her characters in the other films I've seen of hers so far and why she works so well in those. In A Bigger Splash her mysteriousness keeps her at a dangerous distance where her intentions are self serving and destructive. In her second collaboration with Luca Guadagnino with his remake of Argento's SUSPIRIA, she's a foreigner out of her element that taps into her element by way of becoming a conduit for female empowerment through self expression as her character literally opens her heart to us as she ascends into becoming a mater of magic. She is quite delightful in How to Stay Single - a title telling yet again of her loner like status. Even in the 50 Shades series, what draws her suitor is her aloof allure - so casting Dakota in another such role seems to make sense given her filmography.Cassie Web is a child born from murder, and that initial trauma has imprinted an everlasting impact on her existence. Although bitter towards her self-sacrificing mother seemingly placing the chance to save thousands ahead of being alive to parent her own baby, Cassie still instinctually spends her life dedicated to saving others just like she thought her mom was doing. Although an altruistic occupation would imply inherent selflessness, she rather not get entangled in the lives she saves, always choosing instead heroism at a distance. With a need for speed and a penchant for pushing the petal to the metal, Cassie's career choice may even be a mask for her cathartic road rage as she swerves the roads in her racing ambulance adrenaline rush. She may appear to be a cold hearted hero, but like the other characters she plays, her loner emotions keep guarded laying low - in Cassie's case tucked away inside a memory box underneath her bed. But she does keep Julia's stepbrother's drawing and digs into her painful memories of her mother's research journal as she places the boy's token of appreciation with the rest of her mementos - so she's not wholly trying to lock away her memories and throw away the key.She does still have a part of her heart that cares. As a foster child due to her mom's death, she sees herself apart from others on the outside looking in, which is why she finds comradarie in a fellow stray soul neighborhood kitty that winds up in her window every evening. Another comicbook character adaptation that connects to cats is similarly Catwoman, with her post work walkins into her apartment talking aloud to the feral felines waiting for their milk dish as she divulges the difficulties of her day to the captive audience kitties as they eat. Cassie also confides in her stray cat she's somewhat adopted after a long day's work when she finds connecting easier to a silent listener than human interaction. Dakota plays Cassie's character with what could be claimed as a wooden performance, but as a first responder surrounded by death daily, it would make sense to have a cooly calm and collected demeanor amongst chaos. Her lack of emoting enthusiasm would be in line with the character's struggle with empathy and her inability to emotionally connect with others.Madame Web's familial nemesis, on the other hand, is a stone cold one note written persona that when combined with Cassie's already lukewarm demeanor makes for a lack of charisma between the two opposing characters. Conceptually this shadow Spider-man prototype has a lot of potential being the first of his kind before Peter Parker but being a bad guy first before New York gets their hero later. Ezekiel's selfishness serves to epitomize the essence of a villain, someone willing to kill others for the sake of saving himself; whereas, Spider-Man and Madame Web both imbue bravery as the embodiment of heroics in their selflessness by casting aside their safety for the sake of saving someone else.Ezekiel as a villain checks off all the basic bad guy bullets marks, deep menacing voice, perma-scowl plotting and a maniacal single mindedness - but a better use of his screen time would have been subbing Ezekiel's excessively repetitive exposition in place of more action sequences of him stalking the shadows of his nightmares in waking life. A benefit to not giving him a ton of time for character development does draw more focus to Cassie's character arc as well as moments to bond with her adopted band of abandoned adolescents who are ultimately the main storylines to invest time in.Zosia Mamet as his hacker for hire geek squad gone rogue is serviceable in the role, but only has the same reminder of Ezekiel's plan to respond to - perhaps a missed opportunity to play into more of a mixed morality in the storyline with her character if she had flipped sides by gaining a conscience and betraying the man plodding to punish a bunch of teens. That twist could have maybe justified the amount of times the audience is reminded how important it is for Ezekiel to find and put an abrupt end to the girls, as each time her character hears it, it seems less appealing to be a part of. Instead Ezekiel's side kick seems to all together disappear in the story after her boss clocks out early.The storylines and characters do hold some conceptual cinematic weight when analyzing the arcs intersecting between hero and villain. Ezekiel has wasted his whole life trying to avoid a fate he cannot escape while failing to see the true threat which he self actualizes by stealing the spider, shooting her mom and bringing all the girls together because of them trying to escape his hunt. By pursuing the path he plotted in which to avoid his fate, much like Oedipus, Ezekiel provokes his own prophecy into fruition, though ironically it is Cassie who ends up blinded even though she can see more clearly than he ever could.There is an intriguing play on the Sophocles story of Oedipus Rex between both opposing characters. The blind prophet of the stage play reveals the truth to Oedipus about his past actions and prophesizes his self induced blindness. Ezekiel holds the key to Cassie unlocking the truth behind her mother's motives and murder, but if he who is blind to her transformation into Madame Web. Like Oedipus's pride blinding him to the consequences of his own actions , Ezekiel's anger and fear of inevitable death becomes his own grave in the making. He sees incorrectly as if he were blind, whereas Cassie becomes literally blind by the end, unlocking an ultimate sight seer ability. The irony is, as a self accepted loner, she didn't see herself in the position of a matriarch to misfits nor assuming the unwanted title of superhero; and simultaneously, her antagonist misses seeing Madame Web coming either.Cassie Web has an almost inverted twist of fate, in that she doesn't escape her inevitability - instead of dissolving into self destruction in an act of avoiding a doomed destiny, she embraces what's to come and the change with it which ultimately leads to self empowerment. Cassie discovers she was always meant to be paralyzed from her prenatal diagnosed disease, and that her seemingly overly selfless mother secretly had a more personal motive for seeking uncovered medicinal potential in the dangers of the jungle, which weren't responsible for her death as believed but rather by the hand of the man now out for her own blood. Despite her mother's efforts to protect her child, she puts herself in the position to be shot and pays the price, while her daughter still inevitably becomes paralyzed; however, now instead as a result of fighting the same man linked to her from inside the womb.CONTINUE READING FULL REVIEW ON LETTERBOXD: find me on there!

cogisi,2,Cast the bus kid in your next movies.,"While on the bus with Madame Web traveling to Peru, there's a kid behind her, sleeping with his eyes wide open. Throughout the entire movie, his acting stood out as the highlight for me.""Madame Web"" really missed the mark for me. Let's break it down. First off, the acting was a big letdown. None of the actors seemed to bring their characters to life, which made it hard to get into the story. When you're watching a movie, you want to feel like you're right there with the characters, but in ""Madame Web,"" it felt like they were just going through the motions.Now, let's talk about the plot. Have you ever watched a movie and felt like you've seen it all before? That's how I felt with ""Madame Web."" It felt like a Spider-Man movie, but with a twist. Instead of Peter Parker accidentally getting his powers from a spider bite, in this movie, people are intentionally getting bitten by spiders to become superheroes. Sounds interesting, right? Well, it could have been, but it ended up feeling like a cheap imitation of a story we've all seen too many times.But it's not just the lack of originality that bothered me. The way the story was told was also pretty lackluster. The characters weren't well-developed, and the storytelling felt flat. It's like they had this potentially exciting idea, but they didn't know what to do with it. As a result, the movie just kind of plods along without ever really grabbing your attention.And let's not forget about the action scenes. You'd think in a movie about superheroes, the action would be the highlight, right? Well, not in ""Madame Web."" The action sequences were bland and forgettable, lacking the excitement and energy you'd expect from a superhero flick. It's like they were going through the motions, just like the actors.Overall, ""Madame Web"" was a big disappointment. The acting was flat, the plot felt like a tired rehash of something we've all seen before, and the storytelling lacked the punch needed to keep you engaged. It's a shame because with a little more effort and creativity, this could have been a really cool movie. But as it stands, it's just another forgettable entry in the superhero genre."
projectcyclops,4,Like an alien artifact,"In many ways, I absolutely love these types of films. It's just so fascinating to see how they get things so completely wrong. The entire tone of the film is simply bizarre - it really does feel machine-generated. No humanity whatsoever. Watching actors struggle under the weight of such blandness and mediocrity is actually a lot of fun.There's a near-perfect scene where someone gives Dakota Johnson a thank you card, and she stares at it like it's an alien artifact, then states in monotone, ""This is made of... paper?"" and the scene quickly cuts away. Genuis!In many ways it felt like a throwback to the pre-Dark Knight/Zack Snyder era of lighter, sillier superhero films of the '00s. No serious attempt at realistic setting or dialogue, just continuous contrivances and deus ex machina set to a loop of girlpower pop hits. For instance, it is never revealed what the baddie actually wants, or what he does for a living, or even his name - it's enough that he wears a dark coloured suit and lives in a big tower.For the record, I found this less offensive than your average Hollywood 'blockbuster'. It's heart was in the right place... maybe..."
robynbeard09,6,The villan ruined it.,"This movie wasn't bad in general. Cassie and the girls were nice together. It was an intriguing storyline ruined by the villan and not in a good way. Ezekiel (the villan) was so unbelievable that it ruined the movie. He was an jerk for unknown reasons. He killed a pregnant woman for a spider, became rich somehow (no explanation was given), he's able to steal government level tech without consequences to track kids down to prevent his own death.A lot of people blamed the failure of this movie on Dakota Johnson. Nope. The writing left too many holes, the villan and his abilities were ridiculous. This movie could have been awesome. Missed opportunity."
ricetime,4,Not recommended,"If you thought Halle Berry in Catwoman was bad, I feel it was better than this. Marvel should've shelved this as soon as they wrapped production. Were the writers on strike, when this was written & proposed. Who sitting at the table thought that this was good movie script & plot. I stomached through this, thinking that it was gonna get better but I fooled myself. Please don't try to make a sequel, if you do I don't see it getting any better. The cast seemed ok. I think that this thing was rushed, what's worse is that it was rushed to us movie lovers & goers. This is actually as bad as Electra was."
shane-43567,8,Positive Review,"Absolutely loved this film, It was great getting a new origin story of characters that have never appeared on a movie only cartoons or comics,The actors did a fantastic job and I'm really hoping to see spin offs from this film as they left it open and we need a old version of madam web. Really hoping to see more of the new SpiderWoman characters.The only part I thought was abit rushed was the ending I thought they could of kept the villain on for another film for more character growth.I highly recommend people go and watch this film and not listen to the critics have your own opinion of the film."
njacord,7,Confusing but surprising film with mostly bad actors except for Dakota Johnson,"The opening scene had terrible acting from the mom of madame web and the antagonist. Some of the story was a little stupid but I thought it was an overall good movie. The spider people in this movie were so random because they had never even been mentioned in a spider-verse film and these powers hadn't either. I heard that this movie was terrible so I waited to watch it until it was on Netflix but I did enjoy the movie as a whole despite bad acting, random characters, and a story that wasn't that great. I thought Dakota Johnson did a very good job and I like her powers and story but I thought the girls she teamed up with were a little annoying and their stories of why they were by themselves were very obvious and similar which I thought was lazy storytelling. Overall, I would recommend this movie because of it's interesting fight scenes."
PlatanoJones,2,Believe all the bad stuff you've heard about this movie.,"For a few movies they get bad reviews for stupid reasons. This movie is not one of those. It definitely deserved those bad reviews. The trailers were blatantly
Misguiding. And yes you can say that happens in movies often now. But it isn't the only sin.The Bad guy is One note. And that note is a voiceover. It's like they couldn't get a shot of him saying his lines. His mouth moves maybe twice in the whole movie. It feels worse than a bad kung fu flick voiceover.There are glaring plot holes. The bad guy has complete control of all cameras in New York. But doesn't notice the MC take a vacation to Peru. Which let's be real was unnecessary thing for her to do. Should've taken a note from the avengers movie when they cut Thor's hot tub scene. Product placement was very heavy. I won't even get into her birth.Sony stop with the Non-Spider-Man Spider-Man movies. They don't work. You have to weave all this stuff around the factor that it's related to a superhero who is not being shown. Peoples backstories who tie into spider-man completely and your just subtracting spider-man from it. Makes no sense. What's next a how Uncle Ben and Aunt May get together. A rom com about Flash Thompson and MJ. A police procedural movie about Gwen's dad.My suggestion if you want to watch the movie. Is to watch a youtube video about the movie over watching the movie itself."
dermicsch,4,You missed the obvious.,"Sony! You guys dropped the ball. There is just one thing you guys could have done differently with madame webb... literally one thing... could have kept everything else the same, and this one change could have made the movie cinema gold! MAN-SPIDER! VILLAN STOLE THE SPIDER, could have been like the wolf man curse, would have really added to to the movie's horror aspect. Literally it would have saved the movie. For the people that grew up on the origional series cartoon, that saw Man-spider once mademe web was introduced it would have even made sense. A little more CGI a little less, too close to spiderman costume ( which made no sense!) And you could have killed it. Moribus sucked, this sucked. Contact me if you want to actually make a good spiderverse. Just saying."
rdamian1963,3,3 stars is being generous,"Oh how I hate giving low ratings to movies but unfortunately for this movie it is necessary. If this had been a small independent production I might have given it a higher rating. But, this is a SONY major production for Marvel; therefore I am being somewhat more critical. The storyline is actually fairly decent. That is, unfortunately pretty much where the movie strengths end. The script is poorly written. The acting is weak at best. Action sequences are terrible. The directing is awful. The movie is exceedingly predictable. Characters are flat with little or no development. The entertaining parts are fleeting and few and far between."
kecward78-935-120834,3,This falls on the screenwriter and director,"The plot of the movie is great. The lead four actors are great. But beyond that everything is terrible. The screenplay has so many holes and is so ridiculously childish, even your kids wouldn't want to watch this on Saturday morning. I can't believe anyone could produce such nonsensical dialogue as this. And that any people could get behind this to produce it, knowing how poorly it was being created.This could've been a great movie, with Dakota's character gaining her powers before birth thru a spider that bit her mother, trying to save mom's life. But the villain actually gives Dar Ben (from the Marvels) a run at being a really poorly written and stupid character. The 3 young actresses/actors act well, but the writing was so poor it cast them in bad standing, thru no fault of their own.If you're really bored, you might make it thru this movie. I had to ff some parts as the dialogue was killing me."
jessegehrig,2,Next time check with me first?,"I saw Madame Webb for free and I want my money back, no I kid, and I know a lot of people have said it was a bad movie but y'know what, they were right. The movie teases throughout that the main characters are going to become powerful and significant, meanwhile I watched a movie about boring characters that don't do anything cool. Okay so I don't know if the screenwriters thought about this but why not tell the better more exciting story? Madame Webb, according to your story, your characters are destined to become cool, like write that part totally skip ahead to the good stuff. Why would you show the boring part?"
harshacherukuvada,6,"Not too bad, but isn't great either","After Sony's success with the Spider-Verse and regular spider man movies, I expected madame web to carry the same energy and thrilling storyline for the movie.However, even the trailers for the movie weren't so convincing.Madame Web starts out as an ambitious movie, attempting to create a proper backstory and use it as flashbacks scenes. However, looks like this backfired. The movie had opportunity to have so much more than just the characters escaping from a bad guy for the entire movie. The movie's plot was just the characters pretty much going place to place, and the villain just somehow finds them. However so far, the background score, the locations, the designs were pretty good. The cliché storyline was the only thing that could've changed.So overall, I would recommend this film as a one-time watch, and hope that Sony can try making a better sequel."
awilliams-49312,3,"It was so bad, it was funny","I watched this as a joke, i saw all the god awful reviews and was giggling watching them, i thought 'it couldn't be that bad' oh no, it was BAD...
The villain for one was a bit stupid and like NEVER aged. Plus the beginning to end was confusing asf. I was like: ""what is happening? What the hell is happening??"" 90% of the time. Also the lack of spider suits was pissing me off.Sydney Sweeney, very attractive woman, BUT PLAYED A 14 YEAR OLD GIRL?? To be honest, I've come across badly sexualised teenagers but this one takes the cake. Also these were the most cringiest teenage girls I've ever met.I was so so hyped for this as well because I like Anya Corazon and Madame Web, but this film was a massive let down, especially when it's the first spider woman movie. I'm scared Sony is letting their guard down after the success of spiderverse.Also we warned from the beginning, the writers of Morbius wrote it."
waynemal,10,I enjoyed this movie....,"I quite enjoyed this movie and I have been watching super hereo movies a lot longer than most of the numnuts who wrote the bad reviews. Although I am more of a DC fan I also like the Marvels movies and TV series (well most of them anyway). If you rated this poorly then you would have to rate Ms. Marvel as a 1, instead of the 6.3 that it currently sits at. Sometimes, I think some of these reviewers wouldn't know a good movie it it jumped and bit them on the ass. Just look at Oppenheimer, that was crap movie. The documentary was far more entertaining.So please watch this movie with an open mind and don't compare it to other Marvel movies as this is a stand alone movie. Thor or Spiderman won't be dropping in anytime soon.Sit back and enjoy Madame Web."
vnzjbwy,7,Why are people hating?,"I'm not sure why there are so many rubbish reviews.This was a good movie! Did we question the diagnosis intra-utero? Sure.

She starts to have visions of what is yet to come.

jp-62478,1,Sony Picture has done the impossible!,"This film is advertised as being part of the Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU). Their animated spiderman series is great. So are the 3 movies they have made in partnership with Marvel Studios. But their solo attempts leave a lot to be desired.One basic flaw with the Sony Spiderverse movies is that no one associated with the movie has every READ ANY of the comics. You are making a movie about a character that has a 60+ year history. Someone should READ the books, know the history. Unfortunately no one did.When I watched Morbius, I thought it was the worst movie made. I was wrong. This movie is even worse.Sony made a Superhero movie WITHOUT any superheroes! Duh!"
aspigamr,1,An Unintentional Throwback to the Wild West Era of Superhero Movies,"With how prolific superheroes are (mainly of the Marvel Comics variety) in modern entertainment, it can be hard to imagine at this point that there used to be a time when the genre was very niche and the idea of bringing one superhero to the big screen was met with either unbridled sensational enthusiasm or unavoidable stomach knotting dread at how much of a disservice Hollywood was about to do to your favorite superhero in live action.Even in the wake of 2002's ""Spider-Man"", the formula for making a live action superhero film that appealed to both casual movie-goers who knew very little about the source material as well as respected the intelligence of comic book fans who'd been waiting their entire lives to see their favorite superhero on the big screen hadn't quite been solved.What followed was a string of films from both Marvel and DC Comics that either A. Were a bit hesitant about accurately adapting the source material, B. Copied the tone of a more successful superhero film, but only at face value, or C. Had the stench of an out of touch corporate executive all over it.The reason I bring this up is because 2024's ""Madame Web"" neatly fits into all three aforementioned categories.Don't let the promotional marketing fool you, at no point do any of the Spider-Women slip into their superhero costumes not even in the final scene where a now blind Madame Web taps into the live action Spider-Verse to see what's been and what will be.The film likewise copies the ""gritty"" tone of more grounded superhero films that have come before, but ultimately comes off as cheesy more than it does serious since the Spider-Man franchise is usually about as light-hearted as a superhero property gets.Finally, now more than ever, it's become evident that films like these are made, for the sake of BEING made, not because there was a passionate director behind the camera or even because the film has the luxury of falling back on a pre-established well received cinematic universe which Sony's Spider-Man Universe is most certainly not.And what's more, I used to think we were past the era of terrible superhero films. Of terrible female led superhero films specifically speaking, but so long as the likes of ""Madame Web"" which is very much this decade's ""Catwoman"" continue to do the fairer gender dirty in the realm of live action superheroes and more importantly, so long as the powers that be in Hollywood continue to intentionally put out absolute dreck that, no, isn't made any better by having an arbitrary amount of women, PoC, LGBT, in the script, we may very well be in for a resurgence of cringe 2000's era superhero schlock."
tallboy-03377,2,So many plot holes,"So many plot holes, so little time. I'm having a hard finding anything positive to say other than I am positive I did not nike or enjoy this film. It looked promising from the trailer and who ever put that together should be commended as they took all the good parts of the film and condensed it to a 90 second short film. I took 4 of my kids, ages 14-19, boys and girls, and they didn't like it either. I asked them if they had a favorite part and none of them could come up with anything other than more questions about puzzling scenes. I'm trying not to bash this movie and avoid people lumping this review and myself into a sexist, misogynist rant. I went into it with hopes of being entertained and was horribly disappointed. My oldest daughter (19) tried to warn me that the reviews weren't very good but we went anyways. Maybe someone else will enjoy it, I know we didn't."
rob-broadbent13,5,I was obviously watching a different movie,"While this is not the best superhero movie there is a beginning, middle, and end.There is a definite story with a couple of twists. Not too difficult to work out where it is going.Obviously those that have complained at the amount of character building have not read a book for a while.It was not too long or drawn out. Even my wife managed to stay awake through it all, which is unusual for a superhero movie.Doubt if there will be a sequel to this but at least it has been left open for this too happen.If you don't take it too seriously, why should you it's a superhero movie, then it is a reasonable watch."
jaysonpajaronvistal,2,Madame Web disappointingly descends into a chaotic jumble. The film traps its audience in a maze of underdeveloped plots and irritatingly foolish storytelling decisions.,"Madame Web, in its recent attempt to spin its intricate web onto the big screen, falls victim to a tangled mess of underdeveloped plots and perplexing storytelling decisions, leaving audiences ensnared in a chaotic narrative.As the movie goes on, it falls apart, feeling like it wasn't well thought out, disorganized, and lacking a clear vision. The interesting idea it started with turns into a confusing mess, disappointing the audience.Dakota Johnson does her best as Madame Web, bringing energy to the film, but the poorly written script undermines her efforts. The script's trashy and absurd decisions make it hard to enjoy the movie even with good performances.Despite the hints at Spider-Man Easter eggs, the execution falls short, leaving viewers wanting more substance and connection. The performances overall are mediocre, not doing much to improve the disjointed nature of the film.One big problem with the movie is the many choices that just don't make sense. These decisions add to the confusion and frustration, making viewers question the coherence of the story and characters. It's clear that Madame Web is more about making money than delivering a good movie experience. The studio is to blame for the film's issues, as its focus on financial success hampers the potential for a cohesive and engaging story.In conclusion, Madame Web disappoints with weak plots, average performances, and a sense of confusion that ruins its potential. Dakota Johnson's energetic performance is a highlight, but it's not enough to save the film from its poorly executed and unsatisfying nature."
funkysonico,4,Señorita Boring...,"Two hours of movie watching a guy chase three girls who are not going to be the protagonists until the second movie, completely boring... my recommendation, don't spend the money on going to see the second part. At the beginning they show you how the ""heroines"" fight against the bad guy of the movie and beware, it's not bad at all but it never really happens, it will happen in an uncertain future because they never show you what you really want to see. I think that's why everyone rates it with few stars. It seems that Hollywood cannot see its own future and they think that making a first part completely boring, while the second part is going to be ""spectacular"" can work when it comes to filling their pockets but not people, maybe it happened in a very galaxy. Very far away but not on earth or in another multiverse..."
zadella,6,Movie is not as bad as everyone says.,"I think you should definitely try watching for yourself. I'm not a professional movie critic so I don't notice ""bad camera movements"" or stuff like that. I do have to agree some of script definitely wasn't that great or as enticing as it could have been but it didn't make the movie horrible. There's a lot of interesting parts and the ending is pretty good. I think it was lacking a few scenes that make you feel connected to the characters/storyline but I did tear up a time or two still. Overall, this was still a nice movie to watch, I was interested in what was gonna happen next and i don't regret watching it but it's also not a movie I would tell all my friends and family they HAVE to watch."
ajintvarghese1,2,Madame Cringe,"Madame Web tried to add something new to superhero movies, but it got all tangled up. The movie tried to tell the story of the main character, played by Dakota Johnson, but it ended up being too predictable and not well-done. Even though Johnson did a good job acting, the movie had a messy ending and the talking parts felt boring.The writing was full of unintentionally funny moments and boring explanations. Instead of being exciting, the action scenes made me laugh by accident.Basically, Madame Web wasn't very good. It was cringy and made me wonder, ""in which universe is this?"". It felt like a superhero movie from a long time ago, not like the cool ones we have now."
biancamatta-698-465007,10,Brilliant or Terrible? Yes,"With the most adorable plot holes, this movie is a joy to behold, the Citizen Kane of 2024. Full disclosure, in order for this to work you should smoke before you see it and ideally in a pretty much empty cinema, somewhere you can talk openly to whoever you're with (you do NOT want to feel like you're alone in Madame Webb and there will be a LOT that draws comment). Johnson did a great job with what she was given and honestly, it was fun trash that was worth seeing for the memes alone. No it didn't make any sense but that's really not what it's for, it's about turning off your brain and falling backwards into the Webb. Drink Pepsi."
javierbaron2008,7,Laying the foundation for stories to come,"Precognition: Extrasensory perception that allows knowledge of future events.It can manifest itself in the form of visions or mental images, that is, premonitions that arise in the gifted person when perceiving psychic energy, either through contact with objects and people charged with that energy present in everything or by the mere fact of perceiving it in scattered psychic vestiges. In the air.It's surprising how smear campaigns emerge just a few days before a movie's release.A group of angry people who rant against a film, labeling it as garbage and spreading their distorted idea on social networks.I read such negative comments about Madame Web on Twitter and IMDb, that I decided to watch it as soon as possible to draw my own conclusions.After watching it, it is clear to me that it is an armed smear campaign that is lighting the fuse and expanding among the sheepish masses who believe everything they read on the internet.Although Madame Web is not a high-level film, it can be seen fluently.It has narrative cohesion, sustained dramatic tension and a well-constructed atmosphere based on several very well-executed flashforwards that show Cassandra Webb's perspective as she assimilates her precognitive gifts. The scenes where her gift allows her to anticipate upcoming events are, without a doubt, the best part of the film. Especially the scene in the cafeteria with the song 'Toxic' by Britney Spears in the background, generating a wonderful audiovisual counterpoint.The film fails to include bland and forced humorous dialogues in climatic scenes. A humor that, if it worked before, now feels lacking in freshness and out of place.It is not the superhero film that will revitalize the genre but it is not the garbage that some malicious people would have you believe.Despite its shortcomings, it succeeds and lays sufficient foundations for future sequels in which there will be an opportunity to refine details."
dmgabrielnj,5,"Like the cast, great potential, but...","I adore the Marvel characters & are very drawn to the meaning & complexities behind them-esp the relationships & humanity exhibited, even amongst those with special powers; the storylines & to the movies.I had heard a lot of negative opinions about this movie, but usually disagree. Sadly, I somewhat agree on some of the sentiments in this case. I see it. It feels very novice. Could have, should have been so much better.This movie had tons of potential... great cast, great characters. Needed better writing & producing. Should've been done by Disney Marvel production.I do hope that there is a sequel, and that the folks at Disney Marvel are very much connected to it."
jose990,1,The magic cab,"Explain how by ust taking off license plates a NYC cab becomes invisible to the entire NYPD. Better yet, she drives to the airport with the cab, flies to Peru and back and she still has the cab. Is this a magic cab? It has all these TLC markings all over but no one seems to notice.She walked to the diner in her vision in no time but when she actually drove there it became a 5 mile drive.At the end she makes light of the fact that Ben is going to have more responsibility with his nephew. Seriously? She knows Peter's parents are going to be killed and that Ben is going to die but let's make a joke about how he's going to have more responsibility.This movie is mind numbingly ridiculous."
writershiva,1,"In 2 Words ""It Sucks!""","Casting -
I never understood why Dakota Johnson got so much hate for her acting abilities. But, I understood that after watching ""Madame Web"". Also, I realised that Sydney Sweeney is not just a beautiful face but a good actor too. Other actors were okayish. I had seen Isabela Merced in ""Instant Family"", so I know what she is capable of although her skills were underutilised I felt.Story -
The prologue story was beautiful. The plot was good, they could build an amazing thriller out of it. But, it was an obvious plot. Strong villain (who is not strong enough to keep us on our toes like Thanos), and a weak heroine (who is a little too strong and easily defeats the villain).The beauty of the story lies in the fact that hero is weaker than the villain in all aspects whether it was Spider-Man Movie series (Tobey Maguire) or the Avengers Series. Every time there was a villain who was so strong that the heroes had to push themselves beyond the edge to defeat the villain.Honestly, throughout the movie, I did not feel a thing because I could not built a connection with any of the characters due to their limited screentime and quite flat characters. The only character that shows growth is Sydney Sweeney's. A scared and timid girl who dances on the table to impress some boys, and then jumps in the water to save a life. Dakota's character grow better but it's shown so easily that it doesn't make you feel a thing. The movie seems to be in a hurry and it was not that kind of a movie that needs to be hurried.They could have taken extra 30 mins to build a better connection with characters and a few more efforts to make it a better thriller might have brought some appreciation to it.Cinematography -
The budget is good so there's not much problem in that case. But, they could have spent a little more time in making us believe that we are talking of a time that was 2 decades ago. Although, I liked Britney's song.I am glad that it is not a part of MCU universe because if it would have been... it would have spoiled Spider-Man (Tom Holland) for me forever.My Final Words about this movie -
It's below par. The story and the plot had the potential to be a superhit (honestly, an obvious plot but still with write direction and good writing you never know)."
cristobal-281-531518,1,Not worth the time,"I expected more. I wish I had readd the reviews before on order not to waste my time watching it. You owe me 1:56 minutes of my life!!!!I expected more from this movie but as much as it advenced I realized that it was not going to get better.Th efirst time I watched it with my daughter I fell asleep. Now I know why she doesn't speak to me anymore. Still she didn't tell me how bad it was. I wanted to finish it and then, after I done so, I realized why she did not give me a heads up. She wanted to take revenge for me majeing her waste her time!!!!One of the worst movies I have ever seen and let me tell you I am pretty light in my film tastes."
Windermere2,5,MacGuffin Web,"So MacGuffin Web or Madam MacGuffin is not a bad movie, but that does not mean that its a good movie either. It just exists. It entertains the mind for a couple of hours but it never is really able to surpass that.I enjoyed the performance of Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott, and Tahar Rahim. Specially of the two former together in the early parts of the film But good performance doth not great movie make. Sadly, since the movie deals with modern technology and premonition, it suffers from several plot holes that the writers either never explained (or if they were explained, then they were left on the cutting table).Additionally, while I remember being a brat in my teenage years, there were several awkward scenes, such as flirting with teenage boys in a dinner at 8 or 9 o'clock at night outside the city limits and dancing on the table. Sureeeee."
lord_orsum,4,"Definitely not good, but not so terrible either","Let's start with the bad stuff:
The dialogue is clunky at best, the characters make stupid decisions (the diner being top of my list), the villain is one dimensional, the cinematography is pedestrian, the showdown is laughable (a structurally unsound fireworks factory!) and the plot holes are large enough to drive an ambulance through (you will understand after seeing the movie).Having said that, the female leads give it their best with the material they are given, the stakes are personal (no sky beams or world ending peril) and I didn't feel like walking out.Is it better or worse than Morbius - I would put it on par with that film. I also have low expectations for Kraven the Hunter. There is a market for smaller-scale, more personally driven superhero movies, but Sony has not managed to nail it. But full marks for continuing the try..."
willen-91977,1,How is it possible make such a bad movie,"As a die-hard Marvel fan, it's disheartening to witness what appears to be an internal sabotage, a corruption within, aiming to undermine the very essence of the brand that has brought us countless stories of heroism and adventure. The latest installment left much to be desired, with main characters behaving in ways that deviate so far from human emotion and logic, it's as if the producers decided to forgo any attempt at meaningful dialogue or development right from the get-go.This lack of effort to weave intricate relationships or provide depth to the characters was glaringly evident. Instead of showcasing the complexities and growth we've come to expect, it seemed as though the narrative was forcefully steering a teenage girl character to embody traits more aligned with how an antiquated, extraterrestrial male chauvinist would describe. This bizarre character portrayal not only disrupts the immersive experience but also detracts from the rich tapestry of interwoven lives and destinies that Marvel is known for.The disconnection between characters was so pronounced, it's hard to shake off the feeling that this might be an intentional act of subversion from within. A franchise celebrated for its dynamic characters and profound connections was reduced to a hollow shell, where interactions felt contrived and motivations unclear. It's a stark departure from the engaging narratives and complex relationships that have defined Marvel, leaving fans like myself pondering the direction of future installments and yearning for a return to the storytelling excellence that once captivated our imaginations."
asiang76,8,Don't understand the hate,"If you walk in the theater with negative mind set, you cannot enjoy any movies. You will start being picky about what is not good instead of what is good.This was a typical and decent superhero origin story. All i heard from haters reason for this movie was that it is from Sony so it must be bad. That is such a stupid reason, does every movie created by one company a sure homerun? Hell no! Actually watch it before you judge them.People's review after watching it were strange too. Too much cliches or not exciting enough? First of all, this is an origin story and just about every superhero origin stories are the same. Second, this is a superhero that can only see the future, what were you expecting? She's gonna suddenly become spider woman instead??People need to see the big picture and try to understand why things were set this way and not just hate it because people on the internet said so."
koltonbrett,6,"Not Exactly Good, but Definitely Over-Hated","Madame Web is like a fast food meal that isn't up to standard, but it's edible enough to eat. I remember watching Morbius and not seeing cause for all the hate it had received. With Madame Web, I get it, but I still think people are being too harsh on it.Perhaps it's because they are frustrated that it's not the movie it was presented as. It can hardly be considered a superhero movie. Or maybe it's that people can't look past the bad within the movie to enjoy what's actually pretty entertaining if one has the right mindset. The beginning is rough. I started worrying that the whole movie might be this pitiful. But it gets better. I would describe the movie has having good moments, bad moments, and a lot of okay moments.The four leading ladies are the highlight. Watching them interact is fun and they even got some laughs out of me. Each of the girls has a unique personality that makes them interesting. Oddly enough, the best acting in the movie comes from an unexpected small role for Emma Roberts. It felt like she was on another level compared to everyone else, though Adam Scott is also a great addition.The glaring fault of this film is its villain. What a major misstep. I'm not sure what was going on with his voice. It didn't sound like it was coming from him. It sounded like he had been dubbed. He would move about but his voice wouldn't move with him. He was not an intimidating presence, nor was he an interesting character.I feel like if they had gotten the villain right, it would have fixed 70% of what was wrong with this movie. The other 30% consists of some bad dialogue and the fact that this is a superhero origin film that fails to be a superhero origin film. I could get mad about the deception and direction of this movie, but I never felt like getting up and walking out of the theater. But the level of quality we see from this movie isn't setting up Sony for a successful future for their Spider-Man universe. There's some sloppy, cheap, and made-for-streaming filmmaking on display here.Now that we've been introduced to the characters, a sequel could be a lot of fun, if (mild spoiler alert) they give these girls their spider superpowers. I would go see that."
natmavila,1,"Spider-Man, Save Us","If ever a film deserved to be dragged through the mud, it's ""Madame Web"" (2024), a mind-numbing disaster that makes you question if the screenwriters were actually a bunch of monkeys banging on typewriters. This turd of a flick swings from baffling scene to baffling scene with all the grace of a drunken elephant on a tightrope. Dakota Johnson does what she can, which isn't much given that the script probably arrived on set scribbled in crayon on the back of a napkin. The characters are about as deep as a puddle in the Sahara, and the story? What story?The CGI looks like it was done by a high schooler on a pirated copy of Photoshop, circa 2001. Every scene that's supposed to be ""epic"" is about as compelling as watching paint dry, if the paint were also insulting your intelligence every minute it fails to dry. The villain, Ezekiel, has the menace of a soggy paper bag, and every line of dialogue he spews is cringe-worthy enough to be considered a war crime. The action sequences are a jumbled mess where it's nearly impossible to tell who is punching whom, but you'll find yourself rooting for them to just knock each other out so the movie can end.In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a cinematic abomination that should be flung into the deepest, darkest pit of forgotten films. It's a perfect storm of awful - a catastrophe that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. If this movie were a web, it'd be the kind that you walk into accidentally that sticks to your face and ruins your day. Save yourself the agony and avoid this pile of garbage at all costs."
eclarkdog,5,It's bad but strangely watchable,"There is no argument that this movie is bad. Poor script, bad secondary acting, choppy editing, miscast lead even though I like Dakota, and what I think is a kinda lame superhero, at least as presented here. The ""superhero "", who I am completely unfamiliar, is like a mix of the guy from Deadzone and Professor X.I like Dakota Johnson mainly as I find her very attractive, but also realize she is a bit limited as an actress. She does not have the chops to elevate this character or material.The guy playing the villain is not good at all here. I don't know if it is over or under acting, but it is bad. I have seen him do far better in other things.Regardless, I had no issues getting through the movie. It has its moments. It has a feminine quality that I found amusing. I think it could have some cult value."
fabioloso,1,How was this greenlit?,"This baffles me. There are so many good and promising projects being cancelled before even starting productions, movies that never were that could have been great, and this is the type of project Sony chooses to greenlit?This movie is a mess. Nothing makes clear sense, everything seems to be thinly linked together, character motivations are stupid, dialogue is atrocious, the action is incredibly bad. There are so many cuts in each scene that my brain was barely able to follow it. The final battle is a cobbled together mess of bland action and my god what was even the point to any of it?The Spider-Man connections are TERRIBLE and OFFENSIVE (there's a particularly bad one in the final act). AND THE CONSTANT EXPOSITION OH MY GOD. I do not need you to narrate all that is happening in the moment, it's so annoying.The only thing that got me through this movie was Dakota Johnson. She's a star, her acting, even in this mess of a picture, is stellar! It's a shame she's waisted here. In fact, it's a shame everyone is wasted here, because these actors are pretty good.All in all, you can watch it, you'll laugh at how preposterous everything is, but be warned, this is truly a BAD BAD movie."
Coololets,1,Worst than documentary,"Watch with my girlfiriend in the theater and. I fall asleep. Atleast with docummentary I learn somethingAs a die-hard fan of superhero movies, I was eagerly anticipating the release of ""Madame Web."" Unfortunately, this film fell far short of expectations. From start to finish, it was a convoluted mess that left me scratching my head in confusion.The plot was non-existent, jumping from one scene to the next without any coherent narrative thread. It felt like the writers were making it up as they went along, resulting in a disjointed and unsatisfying story. Characters appeared and disappeared without explanation, leaving gaping holes in the storyline that were never resolved.Madame Web herself lacked depth and development, coming across as a bland and forgettable protagonist. Her motivations were unclear, and her actions seemed arbitrary at best. Without a compelling central figure to anchor the film, I found it difficult to invest in the story or care about its outcome.The supporting cast didn't fare much better. The villains were one-dimensional caricatures, motivated by generic greed or thirst for power with no real backstory or depth. The sidekicks were equally uninspired, serving little purpose other than to provide exposition or move the plot along.But perhaps the biggest letdown was the lackluster special effects. In an age where CGI can bring superheroes to life in breathtaking detail, the visuals in ""Madame Web"" looked cheap and amateurish. The action sequences were dull and uninspired, failing to elicit any sense of excitement or awe. It felt like watching a low-budget TV movie from the 90s rather than a blockbuster superhero epic.Overall, ""Madame Web"" is a forgettable addition to the superhero genre. Save your time and money and skip this tangled mess of a movie. With its poorly developed characters, nonsensical plot, and lackluster visuals, it fails to live up to even the most modest expectations."
trentward-01706,1,This was a genuinely dreadful experience,"The best part of this movie is that it ended.. i couldnt think of a single redeeming feature of the film.I really really feel sorry for the actors who were dragged into this probably blindsided by their agents.On top of this the best acting was Dakota telling us we'd want to see it twice..The story is all over the place, the acting was uninspired, and dialog and directing was terrible and the product placement being forced down your throat was an absolute terrible experience however it feels like they knew it would be a flop in the box offices so they sold it out to whomever they could.DO NOT WATCH."
steveinrowg,2,Tangled In Its Own Lazily-Spun Web,"Sony does love money, don't they? There are fewer companies that I believe more shamelessly vie for the cash they believe is burning a hole in the pockets of superhero fans than the reluctant marriage of Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. Quality and care are often sacrificed in favor of creating the next comic book movie blockbuster.As a longtime Spider-Man fan, its almost painful to say that watching Madame Web was a slog. The existence of Madame Web's powers are almost completely absent, with little more to show for it than action sequences that stop and start at a whiplash-inducing pace, punctuated by editing that is nauseating as it is annoying. This pace is done no favors by the nonrhythmic and soulless plot, with its mere reason for being seems to be to serve as a precursor to another (hopefully better) movie. I was hoping this movie's saving grace would be its cast, which was a naive assumption. Almost all of the performances were awkward, flaccid, and cringe, with its cast desperately trying to find the pulse of this cadaver.I will say that Adam Scott's performance as Ben Parker stood out to me. I've always admired Scott's loveable dork persona which he embodies in many of his roles, and I found myself drawn to this kind, funny, and younger version of Ben. He summoned a good couple of laughs from me, which offered more for the movie than any of its other weird, ill-timed quips.I want to say I'm disappointed, but I'm not. This kind of glib storytelling is now par for the course for the superhero genre. Whether or not Madame Web was trying to stand out or settle for a cash-in is unclear. Maybe in 10 years this will become a cult classic among Spidey fans, but for now, it's a forgettable, spiritless embarrassment."

I threw up... The camera angles and CGI were so bad I feel like Michael Bay would've shot this movie for free just to help. The acting and dialogue was so poor it almost seemed like a Kindergarten kid scribbled it with crayons somehow into a script. The action scenes were so boring I checked my phone to see who directed it just so I never watch a movie directed by them again. This movie made me want to give the 2010 Avatar: The Last Airbender movie another try... I'm just in utter shock... I don't even know why I gave this movie a 2/10 and I feel like that's generous.

Hen she was in foster care, just some flashbacks.Could've also had a love story with her best friend.Definitely loved the potential of a part 2. And since the main characters powers are more passive, it would be interesting too see what power each girl gets (I was waiting for it but never came)."
mebrewis,7,Much better Marvel,"Madam Web was much better than all other films that Marvel have been releasing lately. I am so shocked at this low rating as it goes back to when superhero films used to be good.This had an interesting storyline with great music and brilliant acting. This didn't have any forced jokes and was also a lot more serious, an exiting conclusion and room for a sequel. I loved how it was set in the real world with real people discovering their powers instead of it being in space or in a different universe.The end was a little disappointing with no post credit scene but the rest was absolutely brilliant and definitely worth the watch."
fepowars,2,Made for Lifetime TV Superhero movie that Hurts your brain.,"I felt like I had Deja vü of my own. I felt like I was trapped watching a terribly bad episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, that just kept on cycling around and around, getting worse and worse, the longer you watched. Its sad what Disney is doing to Marvel, it truly is... because they could have made this well. But someone (out of touch) tried so hard to make these actresses roles too cool and hip, instead of believable.How? How Does this leave production?The women's roles are silly, the holes in the plot are gaping, the acting is bad, the attention to detail is lost, editing nonexistent, the timeline of events is skewed (perhaps not even there), the teenage roles are pitiful, not believable.The all female cast looks clueless... not a good look for these beautiful female actresses, that have more talent ( I am sure) than what is depicted here... sad.I lost intelligence watching this, which may be exactly what our big cinema giants intended."
jamieee-1,1,Lazy,"Everything about this film is lazy. I don't understand how the same company that has the capacity to produce the creatively genius spider-verse films can think that this is acceptable. Everything about it just screams laziness, it's like they forgot they were trying to entertain people. There is basically no action, it's just a group of young women running away from a bloke with a ""feeling"" that something might happen to him in the future. I accepted Morbius because at least it had some ambition, this one seems like it was created on an Apprentice style program with people sucking up to the team leader with bad ideas.FYI this has driven me to give my first ever IMDB review..."
auscryptocurrency,2,"Bad as, but bricked when I saw Sydney Sweeney was in it","Going into this film with absolutely no idea what it was about or who starred in it, intentionally, I was hoping for a nice surprise. That wish soon turned into a living nightmare ...still though, while witnessing this absolute abomination of a film, I continued to hope, but every minute that went by made it clearer that this was not going to happen and I sank deeper into depression. The cringe factor is high, from checking off the diversity list from the get go, right through to the final scene where Madame Web is wearing terminator sunglasses sitting in a wheelchair. The only upside was when I saw Sydney Sweeney was in it, totally bricked."
jsigurdson-883-591323,1,Don't Waste Your Time > Straight to Audio!,"Despite the movie's $80 Million dollar budget, this movie is painful to watch. Not even all the stunts & special effects in the movie could save it.This movie should come with several mandatory warnings.1. Bad acting
2. Bad dialogue (writing)
One cannot escape the feeling that prior to shooting the movie, the writer(s) and actors decided to bet on who could F'up the movie the most.My vote goes to... the actors. With their wooden performances and unsympathetic characters, I started voting for the bad guy early on. Actually, Mr. Tahar Rahim did a decent job given what he had to work with.If you decide to watch the movie, you have 1 hour & 54 painful minutes to endure. Keep the remote close by and perhaps a decent bottle of wine or scotch.JTS."
gabrielomp,7,Fantastically awful!,"There is no denying that this is a seriously problematic film, but being a bad movie lover, I found myself enjoying it more than it deserved. Not only are their costumes delightfully ridiculous, but the dialogue and the delivery are cheesy as hell. The actresses are cute, but their characters are as unhuman as possible; they talk and act weird, like doped-out weirdos who worship an autistic god. I found myself laughing out loud at one specific line that was not supposed to be funny. How refreshing! It feels like a 90s super hero adaptation gone bad, in the tradition of Spawn and Batman and Robin, a true blast from the past! Please don't listen to the grubby post-MCU radicals. Give it a defiant try!"
xinfulxxvi,1,The Truth.,Who ever approved this movie to be released to the public needs to be fired yesterday. I've seen a lot of disappointing movies and this one maybe isn't the worst but it definitely feels like it's competing to be. But trying to be on a positive note I did enjoy some of the visual effects but it gets immediately downplayed by the poorly written story or the terrible voiceovers. I'm a person that doesn't like to write reviews because I figure who cares but after watching this film I felt the need to say something. In all honesty I applaud the visual effect team because they carried this movie and usually it's the visual effects you're usually worried about but here it feels like EVERYTHING else.
brentojgallant,9,Good origin film,Good story and acting with just enough action. I liked it a lot. There is lots there for real comic book fans and it definitely can lead to more sequels. Dakota Johnson is excellent as the lead along with strong supporting characters. Not sure why all the bad reviews because this movie is just plain good old fun to watch. Strong movie with strong female characters and more of this type messaging is really needed. There is some violence but mostly comic book style. Lots of Easter eggs for hard core fans to watch out for. Well paced and definitely did not feel too long. I would highly recommend this movie.
mwdraper-45476,6,I've seen worse Spiderman films.,"After seeing all the bad reviews I went into this thinking it would be a total car crash of a film and ended up trying to find things not to like. The first two thirds of the film of which I struggled to find anything and thought it was a pretty descent film. Whilst the third act had sine pretty daft moments I still enjoyed the film overall.One of the weaker films in the Spiderman universe, and the bar for me it's pretty damn high, but certainly not the worst.Maybe it's just me but there seens to be a trend of ok films getting really bad reviews at the moment. 🤷‍♂️No it's not a 9 out of 10film, but it's not a 1 either.6 out of 10 for me."
chnclacy,5,It's called Madam Web not Spider-Women..,"Let me sum it up in a few quick points because looks like some people got way too bent out of shape lol...It's not bad, but it's not good.You briefly see the characters in costume... but it's an origin story. An origin story for Madame Web... not the Spider-Women.Under developed villain and poor acting on his part.Ben and Mary Parker were not developed well either.Some annoying product placement.And on the plus side there is...
Some fun dialogue.A bit of chemistry between the leads.Action with an explosive showdown.Good throwback tunes.Some talent here and there.They probably should have spent a little more time on the villain and develop only one of the Spider-Women to tag along with Web.Hollywood often tries to shove in ""up-and-coming"" faces into films to gain viewers but their characters don't necessarily contribute much to the film.All that being said; it's a superhero move - just have fun with it."
nitinnewemail,2,Not a marvelous (Marvel) movie,Huge mess. If only I did't remember this likable face from 50 shades of ...would not have been able to finish watching as well. A little profenity and action would have bring some spark. It felt feeble and out of place. Reminder of Dark knight at places. As if you pushing actors to perform and produce something likable.plot was literally crying to carry along. Never did I ever would have imagined Cassandra Webb would be miles short of webbing something enchanting. I had an epiphany that Spiderman would smile seeing her female incarnation but damn it splatter all over like some poor Chinese glass. Poor me feeling exhosted even to come out with my plight.
chrisbrace300,1,Writing so bad it pissed me off,"I thought spider person movies were idiot proof because they've all been good, but this proved me wrong. The writing and acting is so bad, truly mind blowing. It feels like a group of high schoolers got together and just improvised. The lines, the delivery, everything is bad, and from everyone even the actually successful actors. It feels like this was the practice take of every scene, but then they never filmed an actual full scale take. Even Adam Scott's delivery and lines are horrible. If this was the first movie of any of these actresses careers they'd never work again.Also on Netflix for some reason the bad guys dialogue is not mixed properly to his voice, but everyone else's is fine. Like maybe he had to reshoot his lines in a studio and couldn't get the timing the same. I feel like the premise of the movie had potential, but if this was the vision all along, whoever funded this definitely died of embarrassment."
Terriblemoviecritic,1,Literally the worst movie I have ever seen,"This movie is a complete disaster with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The lack of character development leaves viewers disconnected and uninterested. The plot is random, poorly explained, and utterly nonsensical, making it impossible to follow or care about. I couldn't recommend this to anyone, not even out of morbid curiosity. It's baffling how this film was even approved for release. The numerous plot holes are so glaring that they become a source of frustration, making it painful to watch. The thought of a sequel is unbearable. Had I been in a theater, I would have walked out after just 20 minutes. This film is an insult to audiences intelligence and a waste of time. Everyone involved in its creation should reconsider their career choices. Avoid it at all costs."
daen-86757,1,HOT pile of DOG DuDu,"Verily, let me regale thee with a lamentation of cinematic proportions, for 'Madame Web' doth stand as a testament to the egregious misadventures of modern filmmaking. With an air of anticipation akin to the unveiling of a grand tapestry, I embarked upon this odyssey of moving pictures, only to find myself ensnared within a maelstrom of mediocrity. Verily, the plot unfurls like a tangled skein, weaving a narrative so convoluted that even the most astute of scholars would find themselves lost amidst its labyrinthine machinations.In truth, 'Madame Web' doth serve as a veritable magnum opus of disappointment, a cacophony of cinematic sins that assail the senses with all the subtlety of a rampaging herd of swine. From its lackluster performances to its insipid dialogue, every facet of this cinematic endeavor doth conspire to transform what could have been a masterpiece into naught but a hot pile of dog dudu. Alas, if thou art tempted to partake in this ill-fated venture, I implore thee to spare thyself the torment and seek solace in more worthy pursuits."
kathy-2691,1,2 hours I'll never get back,"I ended up watching TikTok videos through this movie. This movie was absolutely awful. I like most Marvel movies but this was by far the worst. I only sat through it because I thought my husband was watching it but, come to find out, he was also watching TikTok videos.The storyline, script and everything else was like sitting through a movie meant for 5 year olds. I don't know any other tasteful way to describe it. Save yourself the trouble and keep scrolling for something else to watch. Save it for a kids sleepover and let them watch it if they want because that's the audience it's meant for."
princeofpleasure,6,Decent but forgettable,"Dakota Johnson as Cassandra is quite pretty and so is Sydney Sweeney as the shy schoolgirl Julia Cornwall, but the antagonist is quite boring and non-memorable. Ezekiel could've been a decent servile secondary antagonist but he fails to be truly menacing apart from his softcore physical menace. The writing is sufficiently entertaining and the ending is aptly weaved together, but it's definitely forgettable due to its mediocrity. My precise rating is 6,6.3,6 seems harsh because the film is not horrifically abysmal wherefore I detect a certain prejudice towards Sony productions in here but I'm open to be swayed towards that verdict as well due to my blissful inexpertise in these late Sony productions."
no_vampires_here,3,"The cast was great, everything else was not.","I'm not into comics and I had no idea this Madame Web existed until the first trailer. From what I understood, this was supposed to be more of a static character - her powers kinda imply it. Then Dakota Johnson sounded great as a vamp like woman seeing the future and all, made an interesting superhero.The movie is really bad put together and not in terms of editing, it's like there was no vision behind it, it's bland. I got bored multiple times, the writing was weird, many moments that were just cringe like that scene where she's looking around for something to get the taxi number plate off and the camera just goes down focusing on a piece of metal that was just... there! It looked like someone put it there for the camera to focus on. Is the director a beginner? LolThen the movie made me believe there are three more spider like superheroes (the girls) and I waited to see them become their best version of... nothing. Really?I'm not going to get more into it, such a forgettable movie but honestly, Morbius was way worse :)"
geislekm,8,Better than advertised,"I am looking at an undeservedly low viewer score. I am writing from the theater as the credits roll.The plot was fairly original, the acting was above par, the special effects were good, the action and the suspense was decent. The director and writers did a good job.I do not understand the hate being directed at this movie.I liked the movie, and though it is u likely to win any Oscars it was a good way to spend an afternoon at the theater.It was worth my time and my money and no one should believe the poor reviews. Judge it for yourself and go watch this movie. You will not regret it in the least."
donmurray29,6,"A good story, bad direction. Not missing anything.","Giving this an 6/10 ratingIt's not brilliant, the problem is this, we all know why SONY is doing this, just to keep the rights for Spider Man, nothing more, so this film is not needed at all, and you will not miss anything.The story itself is fine, actors are fine, and VFX is fine, the problem is the film is not that exciting due to the very bad direction, a sloth like film, uninspiring journey, action is very badly done, Dakota Johnson does try hard and delivers her best, Sydney Sweeney is very busy, this is her second film for this year, and another is coming in March, she is good, Isabela Merced has fun and Celeste O'Connor does a lot of pouting. Tahar Rahim is a good actor and does menace, with what he is given with. Nice that Adam Scott is used well, for a change.Plenty of set ups for the ongoing Spiderman universe, clever in places, but the problem is the film is not directed well enough, for a TV show, it would work, but not on this. My 6 rating is high compared to the 3 ratings,, so far, it's that not terrible, but not good enough."
strizbiz-99429,5,Another movie that put the cart before the horse....,"Ok....so what I mean...is that end the end...this movie seemed like it was a setup for Madame Web 2......we see all the main characters dressed up in their super hero costumes.....which all turn out to be ""visions"" and none of them turn out to be fully realized in the movie....just what they apparently while come to be in ""Madame Web 2"".....which I seriously doubt will ever happen. Too many movies are counting on there being a sequel and not focused enough on the first one being something that will make you actually want to see a sequel....we get these movies that end with ""cliff hangers"" that feel more like an unfinished movie. There's nothing wrong with cliff hangers as long as it still feel like a movie with an ending. This movies just screams ' our Heroes will actually become heroes in the next movie ""....the problem is that the first one wasn't good enough to warrant a sequel."
Movie_Rating_n_Ranking,4,Why Sony?,"I resisted seeing this movie because of the bad reputation it created, and now I see that said reputation... is totally accurate. Things happen only because at all times, the acting is horribly flat and unconvincing, the visual effects are terrible, and even the sound editing is not saved! There are scenes where the actors speak and the sound doesn't match the movement of their mouths. There was horrible post-production work. It's not understood how Sony continues to produce such bad Spider-Man universe movies.To look for good things in this film is like looking for a needle in a haystack. The directing work had a couple of good sparks, but quickly falls into abuse of resources and exaggerations. The photography is not so bad... and that's where we stop counting.Totally recommended... that you skip this rubbish."
Madcookie17,2,The future looks empty,"An empty shell - that's the best way to describe this attempt at a movie. The early reviews, news of constant re-writes and unenthusiastic cast interviews may have given a hint of what was about to come, but nothing could compare with reality.ALL the actors are line reading. There isn't a single piece of dialogue that felt genuine, but that was apparently good enough for the director and producers of this mess. The plot is a paper thin Swiss-cheese slice that is so blatantly lazy written that it should be studied in universities as to what NOT to do.Zero character development or baseline interest in them, uninteresting disposable villain and non-existent plot.I give this hour and a half long Pepsi ad 2/10 only for Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" in the diner scene."
JJSM22,4,A splatter of comic tropes makes for a web of unevenness,"Madame Web is a story filled with fan service in a storyline that doesn't make much sense. Cassie apparently gets her powers from a spider biting her pregnant mother but is she given them through science or magic, it's never explained. I think one of the themes of the movie is about creating a found family but this isn't properly explored.I enjoyed the teasers into the futures of the three girls, their costumes are amazing but sadly aren't on screen enough. Also the film basically all but says that Ben is Ben Parker and his sister-in-law is about to give birth to Peter. I don't know if they can't say it out loud for legal reasons but it's certainly annoying that they don't just say his full name out loud.It's about what I've come to expect from Sony's spiderverse, apart from Venom the last two entries have been duds. I'm hoping that when Kraven comes out it will prove that the films are worth continuing."
joiningjt,1,"WOW what a train wreck this was, please read my review!!","Ok 1st off the so called actor who plays the Villain spider person has as much charisma as our pet Desert tortoise he makes Ashton Kutchner look like Robert de Niro, the director obviously had no eye for directing which is kind of important in a major motion picture. The dialog was written by a mentally challenged 6 year old and his mentally challenged father directed this tragic comedy. I think it's suppose to be a marvel movie the press is saying that marvel is dead that's not true HORRIBLE movies like this SHOULD be dead on arrival and put out if it's misery and written off. Don't believe me watch deadpool 3 make the most money of ANY film this summer. Sony owes all us comic fans an apology. Don't judge a library of phenomenal entertaining films by this piece of garbage. OK now we go watch guardians of the galaxy !!"
stevejames305,1,Poorly dubbed villain was probably the highlight,"I think this was Clarkson's feature directorial debut and it shows, maybe it was a bit too much out of her comfort zone especially looking at her previous work. Maybe Sony took a punt or maybe they do just like chucking out garbage for fun.If this is what $80 million dollars gets you in Hollywood, I'd be asking for my money back.It's hard to find anything good about this film, the acting, script, story, action and directing are all pretty poor. Adam Scott does an alright job I guess.I think 90% of Ezekiel/Tahar Rahim's dialogue was dubbed or ADR. You can hear him talking and his lips literally aren't moving, thought I was watching a dubbed Bruce Lee movie.It's painful and cringey to watch, but I made it through. Whereas Morbius I couldn't, so one positive is that maybe I enjoyed it more than Morbius."
natashafitzsimons,6,It's FINE,"Look, I just saw it and it's absolutely not as bad as reviews are making it out to be. It's a good time - and I didn't notice the time passing. I enjoyed the relationships, and actually really enjoyed Dakota in the role. It's far better than Morbius in my opinion. Is it as good as peak Marvel? Of course not. However, it's a very passable film - and certainly not a difficult watch. Is it cheesy? Sure, but that's not the biggest crime. I will always believe that it struggles with the same issues as Captain Marvel did the MINUTE it was announced. People who hate a superhero movie that's led by women, and has no man to hang their hopes on. It's fine, it's absolutely not the worst. But, it ain't the best either. Falling on the right side of mediocrity for me."
segundo-68968,2,Why? WHY!??,Why SJ Clarkson even thought tu is was a good idea?I just watched this movie to give it a chance.Hoping people were just exaggerating about but O was wrong.Is just waste of time.I thought The Flash was a bad movie but this one is pretty close to that level.The best part of the movie is when the movie ends and Dreams of The Cranberries starts playing.Why they keep accepting poor written stories?They already have the stories in the comics. The only think you have to do is copy and paste.Literally.They keep insulting the fans with this horrible adaptations that goes to nowhere.Don't waste you're time watching this movie.
pm-98002,9,underrated!!,"I've not been writing too many reviews since IMDB changed the rules that reviews need to be 1,000,000 words long. Yet, here we go: Madame Web is a gem of a superhero movie. This movie has been receiving so many bad reviews - I don't get it. Yes, it's not Citizen Kane but it's a ton of fun, clever and an incredibly uplifting film. I especially loved the ""retro"" 2003 setting without it being over-saturated in Y2K imagery. Dakota Johnson was fierce, as were all the young ladies around her. (Between Dakota, Emma Roberts and Zosia Mamet it did feel like a bit of a nepo-movie' though.) Overall, a super solid cinematic experience."
qpvfygydzc,7,"I despise, cruel, snarky, hateful people","While Madame Webb will not win a slew of Academy Awards.... and rather clunky at some parts, it is entertaining and could have and should have been much better. Dakota Johnson saves the movie from total annihilation and gives a winning and gradually good performance.... Her young costars are equally impressive..... storyline is a different matter, special effects and cinematography at top-notch... and although it can be rather forgettable... I didn't mind at all... It is difficult to understand why they didn't delve into the Spider-Man lore a little more... it kind of has the type of feel to it that Morbius had.... Now I thought that was misunderstood and should've and could've been better as well..... but again it's a good way to waste two hours..."
scottishgeekguy,3,Sony... Please stop!,"When the latest D list Sony spiderman universe movie comes out.... And it makes Morbius look like a masterpiece......You know you're in trouble....Dakota Johnson of (50 shades fame) stars as cassie Webb (subtle)... She's a new York paramedic who's a lone wolf (or... Solitary spider....?)She does her job, lives her life and keeps herself to herself.... She's an orphan, she has a briefcase of secrets from her amazon spider studying mum and... (That's literally and figuratively her baggage for the movie)That is until she's develops some freaky minority report esq pre cog powers and starts to see the future....Before yoh know it she's unwittingly playing mamma bear... (or big sister spider?) to three younger proto spider women whos live are in danger because the bad guy also has pre cog powers and.... That's pretty much it.Soooooooo... Where to start.....As you'll have gathered from my into.... I was NOT a fan of Madamme WebbThe story is weak, the plot is paper thin..... The dialogue is pure Cringey at times... And.... The performances.....I've not really seen much with Dakota Johnson... I've never seen the 50 shades movie (shocking I know....) but from this movie alone..... Yeah.... She doesn't come across well.... Her character kinda acts like she doesn't care about anything.... Before AND after all the chaos.... So.... She's kinda just one note.... She's just blazay... About.... EVERYTHINGTahar Rahim (who was amazing in 2009s 'A prophet' plays the bad guy here.... And.... He's not great. And it almost felt like ALL of his dialogue was dubbed and they didn't spent the time to actually have it in any with his his lips!The three proto spider women are kind of the only saving grace.... While there characters are pretty stereotype... Almost caricature.... Their interplay and banter is actually OK....Went to see it in 4dx at my 2nd closest cineworld and even the 4dx felt like it as minimal effort (side note, the only reason we went to 4dx was there was no additional charge this week at cineworld for 4dx,imax etc....)Felt like a cheesy bad 90s superhero movie
Cgi isn't terrible..... But not amazing...
(what would be amazing would be a wee sub to the channel.... 😉)So.... Is this connected to a spiderman.... At all.(potential spoilers ahead.... I'll leave the spoiler graphic up til I'm done talkin about this so if you want to avoid potential spoilers... Skip ahead til you no longer see the graphic....)So... Spiderman connection?Yes. Adam Scott plays unlce Ben (I mean... That's listed on imdb so I'm not sure how much a spoiler than can be....)The movie doesn't exactly say when it's set.... My best guess is 2003-2010 ish....We know cassie was born in 1973....and she's about 30-35 years old... So yeah I'm guessing based on that.... Based on the cars... The billboards etc.... I'm gonna day 2003...So...all of that.... Plus the be parker thing with him NOT being 'uncle ben' yet.... If madam Webb IS set in a spiderman universe... It's possible it's could be the tom Holland one.... But that means it's also technically in the mcu... So... Maybe not....Then again... The timeline COULD be Andrew Garfield universe..... Or maybe it's an entirely new spiderman universe.... Who knows....(if anyone does know.... Or anyone has a good theory.... Lemme know in the comments...)Potential spoiler Chat ends.So... Yeah.... Actually gonna go with 3/10....it's that bad.....Sony.... Just give up.... Yes... You own the rights to spiderman.... That doesn't mean you should make movie about every single spiderman related character....Venom was OK.... You got lucky with that one....And who knows.... Kraven could be a masterpiece.... 👀Thats us folks, thanks for watching.If you liked this video that like button..... And I'll catch you in the next video.✌🏻"
rlendog,4,Better than the Marvels,"At least this movie was better than the Marvels. I know that isn't saying much. The direction is poor and the writing not much better, resulting in a movie that is rather dull. And like all the other Sony Spider-verse films so far, too much takes place at night or in the dark, adding to the dullness and making it sometimes difficult to follow. Presumably Sony does this to save money on special effects, but it makes for difficult viewing. As a poorly written and directed Marvel Comics based movie led by a multi-racial female cast, I couldn't help thinking about the recent release of the Marvels. And between the two I have or say this one was better. While obviously not realistic, it at least made sense within its own world. And it does share the Marvels' one virtue of staying under 2 hours."
pgcptzf,1,Horrible script!!!,This movie is pretty bad. Confused how investors approved the release of the movie. Some of tge actors were good but majority just horrible. Halfway through tge movie and still couldn't figure out the purpose of chasing 3teenage girls. Just horrible. Waste of time. The plot if there is any was just horrible. Too tie this in with the Spiderman is insulting. Like how could they even approve this movie?? How did the actors even read the script and think it was okay to be in this movie??? Specially the actors with well known careers in the past. Also the majority of these reviews have to be bots just getting paid to write good reviews. There's just no way people were giving this movie good reviews and comparing it to the Spiderman movies lol it's laughable.
funbrowser,4,I was hoping it wasn't bad,"I was really hoping it wasn't that bad as they said it was. But I can't give this movie in all honestly a great rating. It was bad. I do not understand why it was so bad, they had a great cast. A decent story. But the dialogues where so bad it wasn't even funny anymore. Specialy the Eziekiel caracter was really bad. Half of the time you could not see him act, everytime he said something his face would turn away from the camera like it was someone completly different talking and acting.The whole movie was kind of without any direction. Like I said, a great cast except from the Eziekiel caracter. But even a great cast needs direction.I think the writers and director failed this move....."
Boristhemoggy,5,OK...don't write this off yet,"There's been enough lambasting of this movie so far. But sit back and think about it. Put to one side the direction was appalling, dialogue very poor, and the camera work amateurish.OK now you've done that, think of h9ow many other great films have suffered from some level of the same ailments? Die Hard 4 springs to mind for me. It was an incredibly poor end to the franchise, but on the coat tails of the previous 3 it was still enjoyable. Now, if some really clever director was to come back and do a Die Hard 5, we'd be all over it right?The 'idea' of Madame Web is a solid idea. Dakota Johnson was more than up for the task, I'd happily watch her washing her dishes and still be happy. But the 3 girls also played decent enough parts if you consider the poor dialogue they had to work with and the amateur hour direction. So I think of Madame Web as an introduction to that universe.What I'd like to see now is maybe a remake of this one but much better done, by a proper director, with a thought out plot, and a fast follow up film showing the 3 girls coming into their own in some great adventures. I've been bitten by the spider bug and I want more.So OK, this wasn't a great film, but there's an awful lot of shine to polish up and I think there could be much more to come."
celticcow,1,It would be ZERO stars if possible,"Wow. Wow.... WOW! Best movie on the planet if you enjoy horrible acting, awful writing, horrifying direction, bad editing, and an abysmal portrayal of any profession ever committed to film. This will absolutely make a great drinking game or one of your favorite get drunk and trash a movie night. This film has good quality actors, like some VERY good actors. How these people managed to act with no emotion, no facial expression except at the most inappropriate times, and without a hint of evidence that they have any skill, is amazing. The script is so poorly written, I could have done better when I was 4 years old and writing in crayon. The entire delivery is FLAT and BORING. The only way I can imagine as to why this movie is SO BAD, is that the director did this on purpose to show how lousy all of the marvel offerings have become. This film had such potential, with a strong cast - but HOLY TOLEDO does it just stoke its own dumpster fire. I would love to prattle on about all the ways this film should be studied in film school about how NEVER to make a film.... UGH.... it's just bad."
dp_thght,7,"It's ok, it's like a lowkey prequel to films yet to be made.","As a comic fan I was excited the trailer crossed Ezekiel with Julia, Mattie and Anya. I enjoy when the movies take characters and stories I know and reinvent them in a different medium. I went into the film not expecting anything but waiting to see what they did.So, no expectations, no comparisons, I appreciated it for what it was. It had a story and it told it. It was clunky at times but it progressed well enough. It wasn't a normal superhero movie as the heroes didn't have big showy fighting abilities. It was more about character, heroes before they find out who they really are.Ultimately it left me wanting more, but not like ""it's missing too much"" or ""more please, I love it."" It feels like a competent introduction to characters who have more stories to tell that could be of greater interest. I would definitely watch future ""Spider-Sisters"" movies. They will turn the action up a gear or two."
rickbrightwell-399-560921,3,Not great,"I took my younger brother to the movies and gave him a choice of what to see and he chose this one. I had low expectations going in from a couple of coworkers who had already seen the film. However, my low expectations weren't low enough to keep me from being disappointed.There are so many eye-rolling moments in this film, whether from dialog seemingly written by a 10yr old, or from the sheer idiocy thrust upon us in order to make the story somewhat sensible.I don't think I've ever found myself dozing during an action movie until now. Parts of this movie are so slow, and so uninteresting and boring that I literally woke myself up with a sleep startle. Luckily, there was hardly anyone in the theater to notice.Save your theater-going money and if you must have this in your personal Marvel media collection, wait until it shows up in the bargain bin. It shouldn't take long."
RahulM007,8,Escapist Fun,"""You were trying to change your future. But the girls were never part of your future. I was.""The latest superhero flick ""Madame Web,"" starring Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, benefits from its late 90s to early 2000s soundtrack, great visuals, excellent use of crosscutting, edge-of-your-seat thrills, a fun (family) dynamic between the characters, and incredible performances from the main cast. Dakota Johnson shines as Madame Web and spearheads the entire film in a unique and positive way. She can really hold her own, and I can't wait to see her in a potential sequel. I can't for the life of me understand why this movie is getting panned by critics and audiences alike. It does have a few glaring issues, but the good far outweighs the bad. Perhaps in 10-15 years, this movie will be recognised as a cult classic that was judged too harshly at the time. The editing techniques incorporated serve a point. Madame Web is a clairvoyant, which means that she receives visions of the future. Although it is far from a perfect superhero movie, it is also far from being the worst of the franchise. Because at the end of the day, ""Madame Web"" is an enjoyable, fun, and thrilling blockbuster. It's not an artsy type of movie, nor is it particularly thought-provoking or sparking conversations; it's just escapist fun. And isn't that what superhero movies should do?*Shoutout to Adam Scott as Ben Parker. He never fails to put a smile on my face.Final verdict: 8.1/10."
herohire_oo-22428,6,More Terminator than Solo,"Trailers spoil everything, but you need trailers to sell it to the public. Its a catch 22 situation .Honestly it's fun movie that takes a page from films like hitcher, terminator, 80s slasher films than your average comic book film. It has a weird world building Easter eggs/ breadcrumbs in the background but it was no way bad as Solo - a Star Wars story where it practically use floodlights to highlight the character progression of its key moments of its character's journey to being the hero we know and love in the original trilogy.Ignore the hate, it's not gonna change your life, just get some popcorn and Pepsi cherry max and enjoy the ride and make your own narrative on how it fits spiderverse and the multiverse saga."
reefismen,1,Unfortunately awful,"I was really hoping to watch this and enjoy how bad it was, but it was genuinely so bad that I couldn't get through it. Lies honestly the first time that has ever happened. I he normally don't like to put down things that people have worked on but this is truly awful. Especially Dakota Johnson. She is absolutely lifeless when she did not know what to do with a car that was given to her by a child, it blew my mind. The villain is shocking. I almost feel bad for the actors involved in this film but good Lord. What did they think they were making? There is no part of me that can understand why this was made the way it was made."
SoumikBanerjee1996,3,Technical inferiority is the root of all problems,"Yes, the story's a big mess, and the character development notably came up short, but I am surprised to see only a handful pointing out its technical inferiorities, because I strongly believe those were the actual culprits behind the film's downward trajectory.Random Zoom ins, Zoom outs, needless shifting of lenses and perspectives, absurd framing, choppy editing, jagged transitions; the technical department had outdone themselves in being an object of derision.At least the story had an interesting concept to work with, and the characters, regardless of how ineffective and middling on the whole, had some heartfelt moments to spare.I'm not saying it was good; it was definitely bad, but the technical output here was way worse and in my view, made the proposition weaker by a significant margin."
nathanmcdougle,4,Is AI doing lazy writing or lazy people?,"*Spoiler alert l*
Well, for starters it is better than The Marvels.....but not by much. Why does this feel like a computer spit this movie out? Did ChatGPT or Llama2 do this? Be honest. If they didn't it seems like you put a bunch of kids in the room that know nothing about Marvel, zero, and said create a Spider Woman with powers from a Spider? WRONG. How about we take all of that Spider energy and do a Spider Cameo with Peter Parker? The person madaam web should be helping in the first place? I think given that parameter Alexis could have written a better origin story. Lose the spider connection, the spidery village worshipping people, lose the spidery villain.....all that energy on spider spider spider and just use Peter Parker....geez that was a bit over the top, overly complex, and took too much of the film to weave that hot mess together. To be honest is Madaam Webb really an interesting character to begin with? Do we really want to create a sequel or a multiverse around this? I hope not. I hope you're not expecting me to come back for 3 or 4 more sequels on this to figure out who the heck were those 3 girls that Webb was toting around, not doing it. Boring here, boring there, boring everywhere. Now I've done my best to not spoil the villain or villains or 95% of the movie...,..but the flawed origin story needed to be talked about, Now let's talk about powers. She should have had access to them from the beginning.....like that should have been her side hustle from the start because what happens is that for the majority of the movie it's just normal people with normal jobs wasting precious air time, las if to say, ok for the first 45 minutes of the movie we need to tighten our belts and save pennies. No. Why have a marvel film and go cheap. There is going to be one scene that finally demonstrates her powered and it is going to be so lame especially when the camera pans out and you see how silly and impossible what this movie expects me to take in. Hint there is a body of water, a dead end..,,,no where to go but a runaway truck is going in that direction with about 15 ft of runway on a 15 mile per hour max port road? Really it's going fast on that small runway. The other thing I had was making those girls act like air head thots at one point of the movie, it's going to happen about an hour in and will feel very very out of place and annoying, lazy writing. My wife hated it, I thought it was, ok but not watching a sequel; 4 year old daughter loved it and she loved the Marvels. Disney has a demographic problem that needs to be addressed quickly or their only market will be preschool kids (and isn't that kind of the original market to begin with) is that what we want a Marvek novel to be? A movie that Boys, men, and adult women avoid. A movie that only small babies and young girls might have a vague interest in?"
miannucci,2,"Low expectations, still disappointed","Ok, I could tell from the trailers this was going to be a bit rough. I went into this with low expectations, but it still didn't manage to live up to those. Seriously, this movie should not have been released. And I don't think these characters are going to be in the MCU anytime soon.Easily one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. 3 of the 4 female leads never show off any powers or costumes except in 2 places, a very brief flash forward to what I can only assume was supposed to be the (definitely cancelled) sequel, and some quick vague exposition from the antagonist. Even the powers we do get to see aren't shown in much detail. Again, mostly just brief usage, especially from the lead. Building a movie around a character learning to use their powers is fine, but them learning to actually use them before the last 5 minutes would be better.Also, there's more holes in this plot than in Tobey Maguire's costume in Spider-Man 1! I see why people are trashing this so much. It's worse than Green Lantern, The Eternals, Fantasia Four reboot, and maybe even Howard the Duck!"
b_brown167,3,That's 2 hours am not gett8ng back,"This is pretty much an unnecessary film.A woman, whose mother is bitten by a spider during child birth, oneday realises she can see the future and must use her powers to save some young women from an egomaniac with a villian complex.The main character has been rewritten from the comic - not the Madam Web we're used to - and the whole vibe is one of ""we need a female ensamblr film to keep up with the Jones's"" whilst failing to find writers that can write good, strong female leads or parts in general.I feel with most hero films, the writers try too hard to make female characters work and finish up making them look like a parody - the insistence of the ""this is how women do it"" scene being case and point."
cherold,3,the great mystery of this movie's existence,"There are movies that, even though they are critically and popularly condemned, are pretty enjoyable, like The Marvels.This is not one of those movies.It's really hard to think of this as being a ""movie"" at all. That implies a level of thought and effort that I don't see. It's not just that the scenes are lackluster and nothing much happens. It's not just that the action scenes are rare and unexciting. It's not even that once I decided to just keep skipping forward looking for action scenes (because everything was just so boring) I realized that like half this movie is a bunch of teen girls bonding or something, it's not that the movie doesn't seem to have an ending, just a setup for a sequel that will never take place.I think mainly it's the sense that no one involved was interested in making a movie. No one was trying to come up with a story, or characters, or interesting events. The movie is the equivalent of a quarterly financial report written at the last minute by someone who just got fired and its their last day at work. It's just ... no one seems to have wanted to make this.It's weird, because there are movies that get pulled by studios where the makers are really upset, but you can't imagine anyone complaining if this had been scrapped. Everyone would have been, oh good, one less terrible thing on my resume.This movie isn't even fun bad. It's just the absence of a movie."
wrdcwrdc,6,K & A,"KThis movie os not like the other action movies , yet it got me suspension with the story line and its very intersting waiting how the next problem to be solved . !!An intersting thing is how the universe ""disteny"" is doing its thing see how the spider its protecting its self ""or actually the universe"" by making the stealer thing something hhhhh after all his visions been true and got him killedAnd at the same ti.e the disteny got the 3 other girls to be born in specific situations just to help the madame web in her journy !!After all when something is needed the secret descreption is a solid desire and time !!A.The film was simple but yet its sooooo deep and a whole chapter could be written here !"
azsl-52779,1,Rather watch paint dry,"One of the worst movies I have watched in recent memory, and I'm not going to waste much more time on it here. The plot line makes absolutely zero sense, with events happening without any logical connection. There is no character development whatsoever. The protagonists are one-dimensional. The dialogue is cringeworthy and feels incredibly forced, making it difficult to believe in or care about the characters.I am genuinely baffled as to how this movie got green-lighted for production. It seems like it was rushed through every stage without any concern for quality or coherence.Do yourself a favor and skip this train wreck of a movie. Save your time and money for something that at least respects its audience enough to deliver a well-thought-out story and characters you can connect with. This film is a perfect example of what happens when storytelling, direction, and production all fall flat. If you're looking for an entertaining experience, you'll need to look elsewhere."
mogensenf,8,"As a matter of fact, this is really good.","I must admit I wasn't invited to the meeting where it was decided that Madame Webb is a terrible film. So I think I can write what I think?I will also admit that I really liked The Marvels, even thought it was the most fun Marvel film.Madame Webb is sure not a normal Marvel film. Not many capes or superhero uniforms in sight. There was spider people but no Spider-man, is that bad?The lead roles are all women, the director is a woman, is that bad? Actually I think it was all very well played, and really good direction.All in all not the normal Marvel content, perhaps it was more of a thriller/action movie.Nice to see Dakota Johnson carrying a film of this size.I found it really entertaining."
hunter_collier,7,Old type of fun,"This is the type of movie you saw as a kid and loved. That had a Burger King toy and you remember it fondly as an adult even tho it's silly as hell. This isn't a great movie but it's really fun to laugh at and enjoy. I think alot of y'all have lost the joy of films where you can't even enjoy a bad movie. If you went into this film expecting an Oscar worthy film who were you kidding? This is a movie to not take seriously, a movie you turn on and do homework occasionally looking up. Stop listening to me and other people and go enjoy a stupid movie!!! I'd love a sequel to this. Dakota is genuinely really fun as Cassandra, the Parker's are GREAT!"
Ceredon1,1,So bad,"This is honesty one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The acting, writing, pacing, plot and characters were all horribly nonsensical. I suppose this is one comic book character and storyline that is difficult to translate into a movie, but it's like they didn't even try to do it well.I guess there's a chance they've introduced this character for the Beyonder storyline in upcoming Marvel movies, but they could have done so much better. If that is the case, no matter how well they do the Beyonder films, the audience is guaranteed to loudly groan when the Madame Web character appears.Worse than Mobius and that's saying something."
madvfrh,1,Atrocious Tripe,"Waffling along this movie gets nowhere incredibly slowly, shifting through a painfully predictable...""plot"", alongside miserable characters with no depth or real linkage to the original comics.The Director clearly thought they were being creative with the confusing and annoying scene cutting and weird depiction of the main characters skills manifesting, but it just looks like a 4yr olds attempt at art.Overall, a movie I skip forwarded through with great sadness and annoyance while suffering through this B movie 80s style rubbish, quite honestly I wouldn't even say ""just speed watch it"" to anybody because drawing your own comic would be a better experience."
stevelivesey-37183,1,I honestly can't think of anything good to say about it,"So many things are just awful. The plot and script for a starters. None of it makes any sense. Is Hollywood using AI to write their scripts and plots now? The premonitions are so convenient.The CGI is awful. The ending is awful. The casting is awful, Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney are utterly wasted. The product placement is annoying. The foley/sound recording of the voices are terrible.The direction is weak, coming from a director that made a mess of the Game Of Thrones sequel.The way they do chest compressions all the way through the movie is silly and just plain wrong.This is going to loose a ton of money and ruin careers. And a good job too."
jdrendinell10,2,"My biggest question, why?","Let's be very honest, this movie never had a chance from the jump. The marketing campaign leading up to the movie seemed like it was going to be a team up of Madame Webb and three Spider-Women against an evil version of Spider-Man as Webb started to come into her powers. Instead, we got about 45 total seconds of the Spider-Women in future cut scenes while Cassie chauffeured a group of teenagers around while a creepy barefooted grown man tried to kill them. I wish they had either not included the Spider-Women in the trailers at all or actually had them in the movie.Additionally, and most alarmingly, there was absolutely ZERO work done by the editing team. I cannot for the life of me figure out how a whole team of people watched the final cut of this movie and said ""yup, this looks good."" For the entire movie, the villain (Ezekiel) looked like his entire dialogue was poorly dubbed over (think Kung Pow, Enter the Fist). It honestly felt like a massive middle finger to the audience, and it left me with the feeling of ""if they didn't give a damn about making this movie, why should I give one to like it?"" They were also so painfully obvious with the product placement it fully distracted from multiple scenes, from the constant Pepsi rotations in the baby shower scene to the unbelievably intentional camera shots of Blockbuster and a giant Beyoncé ""Dangerously in Love"" mural. We get it, the movie is set in 2003. Product placement isn't uncommon, but this just felt lazy (noticing a trend).The plot itself was not terrible and I'm sure this could've been at least an average movie, but there seemed to be zero effort from the filmmaking team to do so. I feel bad for the actresses, as I doubt this was the movie they signed on for originally.Also, did anyone else find it wild that Cassie made a tongue in cheek joke about the Parker's dying and completely out of charcter for the Cassie we got? I know it's supposed to be an obvious nod to Spider-Man, but if Cassie knows they're going to die, why wouldn't she try to save them? And then she suddenly turns into a Bran Stark style omnipotent know it all? Again, just showing the lack of effort by the filmmakers.Side note, not even CLOSE to how bad Morbius was.2.1/10."
nitinwriteme,1,Pathetic,"I had the misfortune of watching this film, and I cannot stress enough how much of a waste of time it turned out to be. It's rare to come across a movie so devoid of redeeming qualities, but this one managed to excel in all the wrong ways. Allow me to walk you through the myriad reasons why you should steer clear of this cinematic disaster.First and foremost, the plot-or lack thereof. The storyline, if one can even call it that, is an incoherent mess. From the very beginning, it becomes painfully clear that the writers had no clear direction or purpose. The movie meanders aimlessly, with scenes strung together haphazardly, making it nearly impossible to follow any semblance of a narrative. Characters are introduced without any background or development, leaving the audience completely detached from their plights and struggles. By the time the credits rolled, I was left wondering what, if anything, the film was trying to convey.The acting, too, is abysmal. It's almost as if the cast were competing to see who could deliver the most wooden, lifeless performance. The lead actor, in particular, seemed to have one facial expression for every possible emotion, making it difficult to invest in their journey or care about their fate. The supporting cast was no better, with each performance more forgettable than the last. It's a shame, as there were a few recognizable faces in the mix, but they were clearly given nothing to work with in terms of script or direction.Speaking of direction, this film is a masterclass in how not to direct a movie. Scenes are poorly framed, with awkward angles and jarring cuts that disrupt any potential flow or continuity. The pacing is erratic, dragging unbearably."
parthau-15196,1,Thats 1 hour 49 mins of my life I am never getting back,"What a total waste of a friday evening. What is so bad?? Well the story, the cast, the acting. Only thing why I came here in the first place was maybe Dakota but then I just stuck around just to wait and see how worse can a movie get. It is one of the worst movie I have ever watched in recent times. And then all the girl power thing that they wat to shove down the audiences throat. Never works. And it did not work. The movie might be one of the most difficult to sit through in one sitting but thats what I am proud of I guess. I endured. To all humans on earth. Do yourselves a favour. DONOT watch this movie. Let the makers loose their money on this gig so they dont ever dare to create such monstroucity again."
theabysmal,6,"Not fantastic, but not ""the worst movie ever""","This movie seemed to suffer from poor editing and strange camera work but the worst part was the enemy. Dakota, while occasionally stiff, was a solid lead and arguably the best part so anyone saying otherwise just doesn't like her for whatever reason. The guy playing Ezekiel?? Unbelievably bad acting and, most notably, his dialogue was constantly being dubbed over to the point where he was literally facing the camera and his mouth did not match the words! I have to wonder why they chose a middle eastern actor to play a Peruvian but it was just plain embarrassing and it seemed like English was NOT his first language.The 3 main girls that follow madame web were cheesy but cute and if anything comes out of this bizarro flick I hope we get a film with just them or at the least a solo Sydney Sweeney film. She always steals the show and everyone in the theater knew who she was immediately so it's clear that they want more of her.Go see this to just have some fun for a date night and laugh at the awful villain. I promise you that you've seen worse 😂"
rehmankhilji,2,Bad Horrible and Crap,"What was that? How did Marvel Studios even approve of this? There was no coherent story, just some terribly directed scenes with a senseless and confusing plot. It was a truly disappointing experience.It seems like the Marvel producers were preoccupied with something else, perhaps distracted by Fifty Shades, while this movie slipped through without proper review.The storytelling was so poorly executed that even the characters seemed confused, leaving the audience just as lost as to what was happening and why.I'm running out of negative words to conclude this review, but suffice it to say, regardless of your admiration for Dakota, watching this film would be a complete waste of time."
graymonsuta,10,"Not the best from Marvel, but I thought it was alright! 🤷‍♂️","It's not the best Marvel movie I've ever seen, but it was worth watching! I wouldn't recommend watching it again because you would already know what's going to happen next! I would say the best thing about the movie is Dakota Johnson's acting! She actually did a great job playing her character in this movie! But then again, she came from a family of actors, which means she's been given lessons based on their experience! I hope she gets more roles for movies like this, but only if they are more successful! She deserves more than this and she deserves better than this too! Dakota Johnson is a legend in the making and I hope she rises up a rising star!"
lukesters,6,It's not great but it's not terrible,"I must stop watching the YouTube critics because this really wasn't as world endingly bad as they were making out. Dakota Fanning was quite low energy throughout but the rest of the cast and in particular the three girls had a really enjoyable dynamic between them. A lot of the questions which were highlighted by the critics as ridiculous plot lines did seem to have a reasonable explanation by the end of the movie and it genuinely kept my interest until the end. Yes there were the potentially unnecessary Ben/Peter Parker member berries, the bad guy was as wooden as a tree and the lack of any real superhero action in a superhero flick was a bit weird but I have seen far worse movies than this which haven't got half the panning this has. I'm guessing there won't be a sequel if the box office tanks but I would have liked to have seen these characters progress."
falconhart,2,Webtastic webafaction for webos,"Sony has delivered some absolutely movies. The part where she said it's webbin time and webbed all over made me think this is one of the movies of all time. It's such a movie that exists, that it might also cause me to morb. I morbed when the last sonyspooderverse movie came out. This makes me think that madam web could be webbed out even harder. I can't wait for there to be another spooderverse Sony move that is produced. Clearly that will also be a movie. All I can do is thank Sony for having made a movie that plays. It also even had sound! They're may have been a script too, but I'm not really sure."
jacksdad-07398,1,Had to stop watching at the 50 minute mark.,"Getting right to the point. This movie was incredibly unwatchable. I could not endure the whole movie. Whatever you do, don't hit the play movie button.It's amazing is #1 on Netflix. I'm sure I'm not the only one who couldn't make it to the end. The acting was ridiculous, I'm not sure what the Director was thinking about, the plot was so crazy and none of it made any sense.I can't believe that marvel puts its name and stamp of approval on this type of movie. I'm a huge Spider-Man fan and watched all those movies. This movie does not touch the genre. There are so many other movies out there that you can watch and enjoy please trust me this isn't one of them."
jakubsmolka,1,Find me some worst,"This is ultimate disaster :( never seen worst movie :( maybe its connected to femministic style, but this is outranking every bad movie I have ever seen ... if this cost a penny ... than ok ... but for the film budget uts an ultimate killer of fun ... even the smartest person on earthe cant fint a way how to do such a harm to sony ... and here my message to sony: I dont know who approved the budget for the movie, but we cen film it for a half of its price here in Prague withe all special effects and drama thats show off in the movie ... officially film numero uno I will never ever want to see again ... disaster."
mspbpr,1,This!,"I will simply echo the reviews here by saying this is bad on every single, solitary level of moviemaking. I did keep watching it though, to see how each scene might up the level of ""awful movie making"" from the previous scene. And here it did not disappoint.I read that it cost $80 million to make this movie. So in the spirit of writing a scathing review, and hoping everyone involved in making this simply had a bad day (collectively)...Maybe Sony should think about sending that money to film schools where people with budding talent /potential might actually see it realized later on, thus preventing the people who made this movie from ever harming the unsuspecting public again in this way."
danchilton-71955,4,(Web) Swing and a Miss,"Is Madame Webb good? No. Is Madame Webb, as some of the reaction would have you believe, an ungodly affront to cinema that plums new depths in the comic book genre? No. Is it a bland and completely forgettable film that seems to have no purpose in existing aside from rights retention? Yes.After a brief prologue in the Amazon the plot focuses on Cassandra Webb, a paramedic who develops the power to see into the future. The ability seems to be the result of a near death experience but are also related to a ritualistic spider bite received by her pregnant mother. I guess when you're Madam Webb a spider has to be involved somewhere. There's even an attempt spin her powers as spider related but its tenuous to say the least (she sees ""the web that connects us all""??). Whatever the cause she powers up just in time as there are a trio of teenage girls about to be killed by an evil Spiderman because he too can see the future and knows they will one day off him after getting their own powers.There is the kernel of a fun movie in here. An unstoppable killer pursuing the main characters Terminator style while Cassandra use her future vision to get them out of tight spots has the potential for some cool set pieces but the film wastes so much time doing nothing. There is a large part of proceedings dedicated to making sure the audience know this is Spiderman adjacent. Cassandra works with ""uncle' Ben Parker, who just met a women he's really into and his sister in law is about to have a baby, there's even a scene where they tease the babies name. Its all very boring and, given we know it isn't going anywhere, completely pointless. Even once the we are up and running there are only a couple of underwhelming encounters with the baddie and the bonding between Cassie and the girls is perfunctory.None of the cast do anything wrong but they aren't given much to work with. The three future spiderwomen are likeable enough but are stuck with generic teen personas, there's a science nerd, a rebel and one who is worried about being deported. Tahar Rahim is a top drawer actor but as villain Ezekiel Sims he's a walking cardboard cut out, his only characterisation being that he is motivated to kill the girls before they ""destroy everything he has built"". Aside from a swanky apartment and nice car it is never made clear exactly what it is he has built. Lead actress Dakota Johnson can, as anyone who has seen Fifty Shades of Grey will attest, sell some pretty limp dialogue but even she struggles at times here. Its a pity she's let down by the script as you get the feeling she could have been a natural blockbuster lead with some decent support.For some reason this is also the longest film in Sony's No Spiderman Spiderman Universe at nearly two hours. A strange decision given there's so little plot. A little trimming of the fat and better set pieces and they would have had a passable superhero film, by current standards anyway, rather than the cultural punching bag Madam Webb has become. With all mention of their other properties removed from this movie it seems Sony really want everyone to forget about it as soon as possible. Shouldn't be too difficult to oblige them.4 mothers researching spiders in the Amazon just before they died out of 10."
chirilescemanuel,,"Visually good, wholesome with a tint for youth, also lacks substance, as many other movies from this genre, nowadays. Almost compensates with a fascinating settup, to follow","Movies nowadays should be seen under two perspectives:The first one is what does the youngers, need and how does the movie provide with a future where they keep learning the right things, from movies?It's essential, which is why, besides some gaps in the storrytelling - even my little cousin told me that, the end of Madame Web where they would defeat the bad guy, felt weird here and there; it is essential for movies nowadays, that, it may be a better choice to create a more balanced setting, more fun little moments, more morales than the violent settup and risky view of making movies, that we were part of, in the 2000s and early 2010s (us, 90s kids).Which brings us to the second perspective: taking what's better from our age and adapting it to the youth, now!For that..I need to focus on the substance matter.Aestethically and regarding +13 age rating, movie, made it clear it is a self-sufficient movie, for these motives, and it is also cool for teenagers to watch it - heard, out loud laugher in the cinema area, to tell this.So, regarding the later problem with nowadays superhero movies, I will give the perfect two examples of late 2000s and early 2010s movies, which are: Iron Man and the Dark Night.If you did watch the movies or any of them, remember the thrill, the movie did put you through? It's a key word, thrill. It means, every moment of the movie (almost) is felt as if your next 6 weeks of well-being will depend on the outcome of the whole plot. Not only this, but every time a main character succeeds in standing out, giving the right choice of words to the interlocutor or action, it felt as if you can take the example and go out there to try your best in impressing someone or do the same as he/ she did.It felt, much more real.Later productions don't have this kind of setup for a stimulating storytelling. Also, the provocative factor is missing and was exclusively replaced by a more harmless arrangement - it's more like, the flower-power mentality took over the industry and we are collateral damage and can't watch a great movie, again..Plus, in these two cases presented, you can summarise that Tony Stark was as badass as you could have imagined, before even knewing that an Iron Man would take place in 2008 - or Bruce Wayne from The Dark Knight was the most potent and serious out of all the others, played by Christian Bale. They've made an impact on your state of being a teen, watching movies etc.And not only these two examples, because there were plenty good productions in late 2010s, where you did put an interest in characters and you felt more connected to them, then in these early 2020s movies..These movies, mentioned (up, above) - and many others that I won't mention, now, these are seen, from our point of view, as quality.Take from what is, there and bring something familiar into the present way of making films..On the other hand, these movies - Madame Web, The Marvels, Ant Man and the Wasp - Quantumania, Guardians ofthe Galaxy, The Flash, Shazam: Fury of the Gods (going beyond) - may be seen as mediocre, because they lack something important..Which is... old standard for quality!So.. they did start well, with superhero movies.. now, they need to learn how to mantain quality over time and people....nontheless, movie felt pleasant to watch with youngsters!"
destroyerwod,6,Its neither the worst superhero movie of all time or as bad as peoples make it to be,"I skipped this in theatre because i don't really enjoy theatre that much these days. I prefer to watch movies at home. I usually go only to avoid heavy spoiler movies or if its really a huge CGI/VFX spectacle like the Godzilla/Kong movies, Pacific Rim or the recently released Dune Part 2. Its just better watching movies at home for me not having to deal with annoying peoples eating, slurping soda, coughing and at times hitting the seats etc...So that said i was still very curious and ""exited"" to see this one, as i wanted to see what was so bad about it for peoples to trash it so hard. Turn out its nowhere near as bad as i expected...Yes this is not a great movie by any means and it has a fair share of issues. But for one watch i taught it was alright.I would say the biggest issue is probably how little action there is in the movie. The problem being that Cassandra's power is predicting the futur and the other girls are just normal humans at that point while the vilain is a Spider-Man kinda guy beside shooting webs. So its a bit harder to have any big battles.Peoples lately been complaining about ""CGI messes"" in superhero flicks but at least it gives us action and its more entertaining. Here despite a few explosions and such you kinda feel its very toned down and more reminiscent of the 2000s.Speaking wich... The movie takes place in the 2000s. I guess its because they originally planned to include these characters in some ""crossovers"" or ensemble cast or such so it had to be set in the past but it really do not bring much to the movie.If anything it pull out a few things that were a bit hard to swallow. For instance being able to travel right after 9/11 while being wanted by the police. Or the vilain needing some ""advance tech"" (for the time period) to locate the girls. There is a few situations like these where you need to really not think too long about it otherwise it does look completely impossible.But when it comes to me, i can usually just enjoy a silly movie for 2h of entertainement and not focuss too much on these details. I think this is how these movies are supposed to be watched.In other words when i finished Madame Web i taught ""bah... that was ok, i had some fun with it"". Then i watched a bunch of reviews and spoiler talks on Youtube where they dissects the movie apart and yes then i can see all these ""plot holes"" and issues. But on the spot... i didn't really because i didn't focuss on this.Even tough i ""review"" every movies i see these days, i consider myself a movie fan, not a film critic. You can see that i enjoy about 90%+ of movies i watch to various degrees going usually from 6 to 10 out of 10. Im rather easily pleased with movies, i look for fun and entertainement, not art in them, and i usually watch what i think ill enjoy. And even when its a movie i didn't enjoyed that much, often i recognize its qualities and that it was just not in the style i like. For instance when its very slow paced.So for me to dump on a movie, it need to be awfull. Madame Web was not the case for me. It wasn't anything special but i felt it was overall a coherent movie, it told its story.I do have a question tough. You cast Sydney Sweeney in your movie. Why give her the role of the ""unatractive dork"" when you have one of the sexiest woman alive today? They gave her baggy cloathes, glasses, average haircut, but its still Sydney Sweeney ... and her big ...assets. She was really misscast in my opinion.Well that was a long one. So overall no its not ""so bad its good"" like Batman & Robin. But its neither so bad and boring as Catwoman. I think i may had liked this one more than Morbius personally. I was fine seeing it once, but not really interested to rewatch it ocasionally like Phase 1-3 of Marvel movies."
wwwgabereis,1,I threw up from motion sickness,"Between motion sickness, in your face pepsi product placement, and the Hollywood trend of needing to pander to everyone, making sure tomake a guy the bad guy , and needing the diversity of one independent latina , one sassy black girl and one nerdy red hair white girl, and one Burnett with mommy issues... The trope is cringe that they consider in your face inclusion or maybe making it a feminist dream ... All that aside the camera work and editing will make you sick , even in the beginning of the movie when you see a rapid zoom in and zoom out several times you should know to leave the theater or delet your copy or snap your bluray in half. The story telling was literally the worst writing in modern time the acting and costume department also failed so very extremely hard making each outfit look like it was made by someone blind. The only reason i could think why this movie was made was to launder money or claim it as a write off. Holy effing hell it was bad. Its so bad and insignificant you really dont need to watch it. Its not even so bad its funny, its so bad that i feel like someone stole money from me and mor importantly my time. This director and executive producer need to be barred from making anything in the Hollywood industry."
kurtmichael,8,Decent Origin Story,"This film is clearly under appreciated since it breaks the typical Marvel/MCU mold. But the fact is, this film is well-executed, cerebral, interesting, and engaging. Many of the low ""reviews"" this film is getting are just the pathetic little fanboys who are intimidated by strong women, so they're review-bombing the film without even seeing it. But if you go into this film with an open mind, ready to be entertained, you'll enjoy it. This movie is clearly a setup for several future films, so as this cinematic saga continues to progress and evolve, this film will become more appreciated as time passes. This saga will grow."
totem9,7,Really!? You hate this! Why?,"So many negative reviews. There are Dakota haters. There are, ""It's not your (imaginary) best Marvel movie expectation haters.I was entertained. That was what I wanted. It provided that for me.A lot of reviewers seem to be looking for a heroin-like reaction, like the Matrix series. Each Matrix was a little less ""good"" than the previous one. But if you look at each one as a stand alone effort, they perform. They entertain. You cannot get the same high or a better one from the ""next one,"" especially if you expect to get a better high that the last one. Then you simply ""must tell us how disappointed you were"" that ""this did not do it for me.""Madame Web is a good story with a very decent Marvel story line. The best I ever saw? No, but I had a good experience with believable imaginary characters in a good imaginary story line with a good vs evil story with good prevailing. The acting was what I expect from such a movie. It was noticeably better than I expected from reading the reviews (which I rarely do for a movie I already decided to watch for that reason). It's not like a later & later Bruce Willis movie. They all suck - he'd lost his edge from increasing medical issues. Some of them include him for very short times.If your expectations were higher, why did you watch it? You already didn't like 1 or more things about about it before you clicked ""Play"". Why waste your time watching it & why waste our time our time ranting about your disappointments.If you cannot say something nice, bug off. Keep your ""review"" short...Sorry about MY rant, BTW..."
chanfle,1,My intellect is damaged after seeing this,"This must have to be the worst superhero movie ever made. Don't watch it ever. Producers in Sony must have been on drugs when they approved to release this movie. It was made bad un porpoise. The screenplay, edition, production, storyline, acting, effects, product placement, scenery, you name it, are HORRIBLE.This is the first review I have ever written in IMDb because no other movie has ever deserved before. It is a shame for actresses like Dakota and Sydney that they are part of this movie.On the other hand, the only thing that I liked was that she could see what it was going to happen.Save your money, time and keep in with your lives.Nothing will happen if you don't see this movie ever."
jscwhkgkh,,This must be a joke,"I started to watch it without knowing anything about this show, as I just reactivated my account and went for the first new title I saw.Decent production quality made me keep watching even if I found the dialogue not sharp enough to make me buy into the story and left wondering how a show like this made it to the big leagues and then it started happening: one after the other all the other little nepo babies started popping up like pretty dandelions and the everything made perfect sense. Just an innocent vessel for those poor soul to get their break, a denonstration of love, the gift of a chance for those poor daughters who have had all door closed in their faces because of who their family is. Poor nepo babies deserve a chance to be shoved down our throats like everyone else!If you are militant around ""champagne social justice"" this is your show."
marwinsingh-30063,2,Sony messed up big time...,"I can't believe that what i just saw, an 2 hours of mess created by the sony in their another failed attempt of establishing a spider man shared universe but without spider man...at this point it's just laughable...i mean they marketed thidm movie as a action packed adventure filled with some female cast representing the spider woman and legendry madam web who connects all spider man universes with her web of destiny;but in the end it was all a big lie..film spents too much time setting up the future that may never come..the biggest dissapointment for me was getting tricked into believing that we were going to see spider womens in this movie as trailer suggested butthey didn;t even suit up at all.lol i was more of a tease for sequels that may never come,,, there is no action in this film not even a single fight scene just a terminator style surviving the chase from bad guy movie which falls flat after a short run time..Ezikel Sims could have been a great spider man copycat villain in some other good marvel project but they wasted him; acting is sometimes laughable in this movie and that happens when you cast actresses on the basis of their looks instead of acting skills..
Sony is the same studio that holds the rights to biggest marvel character of all time and as of 2024 THERE ARE 3 DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF SPIDER MAN ARE RUNNING IN MULTIVERSE...read that again ; but they still fail to establish a shared universe...what is the point oof SSU when there is no spider man in this universe.... there are wasting money on these crap projects like venom 2' Morbius and now this disaster instead they can make TASM 3 or SM 4 ..the best thing about this movie is thank god it is not connected to any of those 3 versions of spider man otherwise it would have destroyed that universe by establishing the forced connections that were never meant to be present first place at all.... A BIG DISASTER......SHAME ON YOU SONY FOR TORTURING US."
bribranand,1,seriously insulting to fans,"How dare they release this movie. The villians dreams up the plot motivation. Uses computers in 2003 to find the faces from his dreams. Removes the masks, and deages them. Hires a female assistant to hunt down three innocent women only to be threatened herself by a real life killer. CPR is over used in this film like you wouldnt believe. Uncle Ben and Aunt May give birth to presumably peter parker which is not what uncles and aunts do. That is probably the most brain dead thing this film does besides the dancing to toxic on a table while trying to lay low. If youre a fan dont give them a dollar."
samlubbardo,1,Waste of time and money,"Do producers think we've become so dull, that we can't tell a lazy writing, ideologically hysterical casting and overall poor product from a good movie? No, quite the opposite. This movie's worst feature is that they probably commited to make a sequel already. But if they fire lousy writers, employ professionals to actually create a story, focus less on soda ads and more on acting and bring some believable actors instead of mindlessly smudging ""diversity"" all over the screen..they might get to 4/10 at least with the sequel and let it all be forgotten with a good feeling that they only created one terrible piece and learned from it. But...will they?"
slotempo,1,Ugh....,"Madame Webb just hit Netflix..
Going to save you some time.Truly, truly I say, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Hands down.2 hours of my life I'll never get backIf you don't believe me, catch the first 20 minutes, and it never ever gets any better.The superheroes in costume at the beginning of the movie exist in a total of about 4 minutes of screen time in nothing but 2 dream sequences.What you saw in the trailer is about all you get.Horrible acting
Horrible plot
I'm trying to find out if the director ever graduated kindergarten.I would have better entertainment pounding my feet flat with a wooden mallet...
Horrible.Where is the ""zero stars"" button?"
kzenpao,3,A film salad...,"It starts like ""The jungle book"" .. It goes like ""The Final Destination"" .. Continues like ""The Terminator"" and ends up like the Professor X being a living Cerebro😅😅. Of course at the very end the all mighty villain from a powerful and fast acting guy transforms to a slow and weak one.. For an instant I felt like I had her superpowers cause I predicted every scene that was coming.. Last of all I don't get that thing with the female super heroes. Nobody really wants it but they keep doing it. Thank you Marvel(actually Disney) for destroying another concept.. What's up next show I won't pay to see it. So some respect."
alejangg,7,Ok... not that bad,"Critics are at it again. In their defense they are doing their job which is......... critiquing. Honestly though this film was enjoyable, good story with a good cast.Don't believe every negative review you have read. I get that it is a superhero marvel film so the bar is high, but I feel like others will enjoy this. I also went to the theatres with very low expectations because of the reviews this film had going into opening day, but I gave it a chance anyways and I enjoyed it. CG was pretty enticing as well as the story line. So go see it, don't listen to all the reviews, some people really just expect too much."
steveatwal,5,"Bad Writing, Bad Directing, Bad Villain","This movie could have been so much better if it didn't have the dumb moments. For example:
it seems Cassandra (Madame)'s medical training is limited to doing compressions ðŸ˜‚ Almost every scene she's in, helping someone medically, she's doing compressions...it doesn't matter if the victim is a drowning victim, or a poison victim ðŸ˜‚ Young people will walk away thinking compressions is the only thing they need to do!and what about her driving a stolen taxi (without license plates) for days? Why wasn't she stopped by the police?? Plus, taxis usually have a GPS system so the main office can track their drivers locations...useful if a taxi is stolen!and the big one: at the end, Madame is blind and in a wheelchair? Why? She was drowning and was saved...how did that affect her eyesight and not being able to walk?They needed better writers and producers for this. On the positive side, the main actors/actresses did a great job. The villain was just not bad enough, and too easily defeated. Pity, this could have been so much better."

dmoorejr,7,Overrated. Understated.,"Yall are some haters for sure! Madame Web was better than The Marvel's, Ms. Marvel, She/Hulk, and Morbius! The visuals were pretty solid! I guess if there was terrible looking blue screen in every shot like a Marvel Studios movie yall would be drooling over this movie. This actually told a cohesive story, with tons of heart. While you could argue about all the plot points you didn't like all day, from a production standpoint it's a well made film. The cinematography/ color grade was fantastic. The set design actually blended in so well, I couldn't tell where the blue screen normally is. Also I loved the editing surrounding her premonitions. The quick paced editing actually moves the movie along quite well. Curious to see where Sony takes these characters next."
mariagsolsen,3,It's quite incredible...,"... that they did not see how cringy they instructed it! It is almost funny, but mostly just sad as Madame Web has so much potential!I knew that the movie was gonna be, well not good looking at the stars it already had recieved however, I relly like Madame Web and had to try it out! I myself rarely give under five stars ðŸŒŸ but this is really poorly created.The actors are great and it is clear that they were instructed extremely poorly and that the screenplay as well is really off. There was so much potential in Peru and the motives behind the characters are not supported or explained well enough.Too bad, really!"
samridhknight,1,Not even a web string worth of movie.,"Waste of time.Saw this movie and it was a waste of time and money, right from the beginning it feels like a sitcom with little bit of action here and there. Plot is confusing and absolutely cringe. Charecters does not connect very well, whole movei feels like forced on the viewers.Dakota has delivered great performace as usual, but unfortunaely still not worth for cinema, baetter to watch it on OTP release.Great to see that non of the Spider charactres were in the movie.Main villain is just jumping from roof top to another without any web sling, dont know if the makers were trying not to make this a spider movie or were they?"
anirain,1,What happened with writers in this industry?,"The script, the dialogs, the costumes design, down to the wigs, the CGI, the choreography of the fight scenes and the angles of some shots are very ridiculous (starting with the ""where's my spider"" scene).And yes, we all saw that damn PEPSI word, loud and clear!Oh, Dakota, we have to redo that scene.What's wrong? Something with my performance?Ahahah. No, dear, you put your finger on the letter P and it is unreadable!Also, sometimes we see glimpses of good movies and even good shot (and they bright on other background). So some miserable people put souls and efforts into this movie."
southdavid,4,Web of Deceit.,"I find myself again talking about expectations. Based on the reviews I saw ""Madame Web"" expecting a hilariously awful, unwatchable, catastrophic joke of a movie. That's it's then just, a four out ten, disappointing effort was actually a pleasant surprise.With her mother killed whilst hunting in the Amazon for a rare spider, Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) grows up to become a paramedic. Following a near death experience she starts to see visions she comes to realise are of the future. In one vision, she sees a man with Spider like abilities kill three seemingly unrelated young women on the subway. She saves the girls and discovers a link between them and herself, and with the work her mother was undertaking.Don't get me wrong here... this is not good. It seems, from the reading, that it's exactly the sort of bland, tedious affair that is generated by endless studio interference, which seems to have created an entirely different movie than the one that Dakota Johnson signed on to make. I suspect that it stems from a desire not to make a good movie, necessarily, but to make the one that has the least risk of losing money. It's hard to shake that feeling that the actors in this had their enthusiasm taken from them by the rewrites and changes, and so the flat delivery that most of them offer stems from that.There are elements that don't make sense. Personally, I didn't struggle with the time elements, or even the slightly daft ""you can be in two places at once"" element to her power. No, I struggled with a firework being able to knock a wall down. Or how, whilst a wanted criminal, Cassie takes a flight to Peru and back. I reviewed ""Anyone But You"" earlier this year and talked there about how odd it is that we're simultaneously having Sydney Sweeney as a credible romantic partner for a man whose nearly forty, and here as a teenage girl.Let me say again, I think this is a bad film, not quite as bad as ""Morbius"" for me, but as bland a superhero movies as has ever been made. I just don't think it's quite as disastrous as it's been made out to be."
nicksmoviereviews,2,As bad as we thought.,"""Madam Web"" fails to deliver on its promise, leaving audiences with a lackluster and forgettable experience. The film's narrative is convoluted and disjointed, making it difficult for viewers to engage with the story or its characters. Despite the talent of the cast, including A-list actors, the performances feel uninspired and fail to elevate the material. Visually, the film falls short, with subpar special effects and unimpressive action sequences. The pacing drags, making the already tedious plot feel even longer. Overall, ""Madam Web"" is a disappointment, lacking the depth and excitement fans expect from a superhero movie. It adds little to the character's mythos and will likely fade into obscurity among the plethora of forgettable adaptations. Fans of the character would be better off revisiting the comics or animated series for a more satisfying experience."
ebhaam,1,Sony proved SSU Is worse than DCEU,"The movie is Awful, A cheap Copy of Final destination Franchise, choosing Dacota Johnson as Cassandra Webb is the worst Decision that sony ever had, S. J clarkson poor Direction proved, morbius is a masterpiece piece when we compare it with Mademe Web movie, sony please Stop creating movies like this, instead Sony should work with Marbel Stodius, even worst reviewed MCU movies, Ant man and the wasp Quantumania and Eternals was Far better than this , with 80 million Dollars budget they made a weak movie, The creator 2023 also has 80 Million Dollars budget, but Creator, has Great Cinematography, Great Sound effect... Not like this, overall 1/10 For Mademe Web."
KFstudios2009,6,Madame Web Without The Web.,"Madame Web, the Sony Spider-Man Spin-off, about Cassandra (Or Cassie) Webb that discovers the abilities to see the future. After many visions, she has to save three girls that on some way or other is connected to her. Everything is connected somehow in the film, and the poster tagline ""Her Web Connects them All"" gives a lot of sense for me now. For the story, I can safely say that this was a very ok spin-off to a great universe, it doesn't show that big connection to the spider-verse here, but if this film gets a sequel, then I can call it a fair start. Nothing that's amazing, just ok, good enough story, Madame Web introduced as a character performed by Dakota Johnson was nice, she was carrying her role good, and her performance? Well, it had good parts, but she was very decent, I can't really say much about her. The three girls she meets afterwards, Julie, Mattie and Anya had a very important meaning for the story, and that was very cool, yet as characters I think they were very goofy and weird and I'm not sure if I liked them or not. Something about the trio was strange, I felt like they missed the coolness, something missed you know. But them co-operating with Madame Web was showed greatly, the friendship and so. The main villain dressed up in a Spider-Man like costume was ok. He isn't that rememberable, but I liked how they showed the figure of Spider-Man as something evil, I think it was needed for the film. The ending of the film felt to moralising, too much talk like: ""Fight for what you love"" or ""Never give up your dreams"" and all this damn moral that felt too pushed in wasn't that good. If they didn't have that and could have a better structured ending after the epic final fight, then I think a star higher could be added to my rating. The action went very fine, the final fight did hit really great, as well as the previous fights that came along on the way. I watched it in 4Dx and personally it was a bit overwhelming, not all of the features and effects did hit the spots on the film, but that is not the film's fault. The editing and dynamic camera angles was very good and carried a big part of the film. The motage was very fast-paced and cool, as well as all of the cuts and transitions. The music score was ok, introducing on the way Britney Spears song ""Toxic"" that fit one of the action scenes. After all, Madame Web was an ok film, it entertained, some things could be better, but this should probably be a fun way to spend your time."
adeelahmed-92376,1,Weird!,"Movie is dominantly disappointing. Didn't even feel to review, but some poor content must be rated so that next time betterment occurs. A poor distribution of concept and junction of knowledge of a movie. This happens when people get over-confident about what they actually made. All those actors who were in this movie must retire this comic movie creation immediately and should never try to look cool. Waste of total Budget over some movie which doesn't evens deserves to be at cinema. Nothing looked good about it, an absolute demolition of comic book movies. All the friends were disappointed after watching."
Trleslie,10,It's a good movie,"I just want to say it's a good movie, the cast and everything was just perfect. It felt like they were made for the role of the characters in the movie. I honestly don't know what else to say then just for people to give it a try. It's one of the movies I liked that came out this year and I don't say that much for things I watch. I liked the ending, I felt that it was the perfect ending for the movie and will like for the movie to have a sequel too. I will definitely watch it again and will like to watch a sequel of it. Love the movie, liked the ending, I honestly have nothing bad to say for the movie."
badavis42,6,Pleasantly surprised,Was it amazing? No but it held my interest better than other recent Marvel releases. I found Dakota Johnson entertaining to watch throughout the whole movie. There's a lot of girl power and I say that as a woman but it was better than I expected given its reviews! I thought it was a good origin story and I liked how it brought in Spiderman elements too. There were some cg moments that were a little awkward but that happens in a lot of movies. I'm actually surprised it's getting bashed the way it is because it was a pretty good movie I felt. It's not supposed to really be a Spiderman movie and I actually prefer that they didn't lean on the Spiderman side of things. I had never heard of Madame Web before this and I think she's pretty cool!
kluseba,5,Caught in the Web of Shallow Superhero Flicks,"I have never been a fan of Marvel's cinematic universe since the vast majority of its films are boring, predictable and shallow. If you wonder why I even bothered watching Madame Web, then I would like to let you know that I had to attend this film because of my job. The reviews for this film were particularly negative and even adamant fans of the Marvel franchise were harshly critical of this movie. For the very first time regarding a cinematic release of the Marvel franchise, I must honestly admit that this movie isn't as bad as most people claim. I'm not going to tell you that it's a great or even a good movie because it isn't but it ultimately qualifies as average flick.The story revolves around antisocial paramedic Cassandra Webb who experiences signs of clairvoyance. She thus saves the lives of three teenagers who are targeted by a mysterious enemy. Cassandra Webb soon learns that the brutal antagonist is also related to her own past. The paramedic thus supports the three teenagers in defeating their powerful enemy.On the positive side, this movie manages to entertain through most of its running time and features only a few unnecessary scenes. The settings of the jungles of Peru in the seventies and a busy New York City in the early years of the millennium complement each other particularly well. The film's special effects have been created with care and especially the final fighting scene at a firework factory should be enjoyed on the big screen.On the negative side, the actresses and actors lack emotions, empathy and energy to appeal to the audience. Lead actress Dakota Johnson is particularly pale and incarnates one of the least sympathetic protagonists I have come across in quite some time. The story is insultingly predictable to appeal to a wide audience and particularly to young teenagers and children. The ridiculous references to the Marvel universe in the film's conclusion feel pulled out of thin air.At the end of the day, Madame Web is a decent movie for anyone who is looking for an entertaining fantasy film with beautiful locations, thorough pace and impressive special effects. Anyone who is hoping for great acting skills, a clever story or any elements breaking new ground can skip this film entirely. Madame Web isn't as bad as some harsh critics claim but it remains an average movie that will only appeal to adamant fans of Marvel Comics. Here's hope that at least some viewers will finally understand how shallow these superhero movies are, stop promoting them by watching them and thus inspire brave, creative and fresh change in cinema."
davidwalker-94471,1,Web of deceit,"Dakota Johnson has done well to recover from the 50 shades series. Man I hate those movies.This is a new career low.If you'd never seen a superhero movie and you watched this, I fear you'd never watch another.All of this movie sucks. All of it.I'm not going to say anything that hasn't been said besides the fact that i just can't find anything to defend. Literally the only thing I enjoyed was the cranberries song 'Dreams' during the closing credits.I only watched this because I wanted to judge for myself rather than believe the hype. Well, anti hype.I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it."
jbaird-64914,1,It's like they tried to make the worst movie possivle,"This is genuinely one of the worst movies I've ever seen I just had to come here and vent. At the beginning it was actually somewhat okay but it spiraled so bad. The villain is truly hilariously bad and there's just like no explanation for him or his origins, they mention a curse at some point with no context?.. The younger girls are all hilariously bad too, especially at the end it was hilarious with their cheesy little ""I'll save you!"" Lines. The director of this movie should never direct another movie. I don't understand why these studios just continue to try and hire the wrong people for the job based on everything but talent. You'd think they'd learn after The Marvels but Sony apparently wanted their shot at a bomb too. If you have absolutely nothing going on maybe have it on in the background while you're in your phone."
kingcasey_iii,1,This movie is sheety pants pants pant,"Sheety pants pant pants pants sheeeety pants pants panta pants. And WHY? Lame writing, lame acting, lame delivery. A cheap soulless cash grab typical of the Sony dimension of the Marvelverse. Not to say the Disney Dimension of the Marvelverse, or the Marvel Dimension of the Marveverse, are any better.It' just seems like writers after a century of writing quality scripts just plain ran out of ideas.Plot... if that's what the writers call it: a clairevoyant woman's latent precognitive abiliites manifest on a stressful day as an EMS. She witnesses 3 random teens demise at the hands of a villian and vows to protect them with her precognitive knowledge.She developed her skills by being born from her mother who was bitten by a Amazonian spider who's venom evolves her."
ashtonbarnes-73298,1,Nahhhh,"With great responsibility, comes great power! What an oof. Just watched Madam Web, and I couldn't be more interested. I am so interested on how writers can be so bad but still get a job at Sony! The villain was boring and the ending was badly made and very anticlimactic. The dialogue was awkward and wasn't easy on the ears. This movie made Eternals look like endgame! I honestly feel bad for the actors, because the actors in this movie are actually really good. This is 2 hours I can never get back. I knew going in that it was going to be bad but I didn't expect it to be this bad. Although I have said that this is a terrible movie, I would still recommend to watch this so that you can it's low quality for yourself!"
amrselima,4,Good story but poor execution,"A superheroes movie with no superheroes in it
A very weak villain
Errors in editing
The characters are not compatible with each other
Madame Web's superhero outfit is bad
The Spider-Man hints were bad
The three girls outfit were good but didn't appear for more than five minutes
I don't understand why they didn't mention Peter Parker's name in the scenes hinting at him
The positive thing about the movie is Dakota Johnson's acting performance
The way she lost her sight was good
I hope that if Madame Web appears in the future, they will take advantage of her abilities better than that
A wasted opportunity. The story is good, but the execution is very poor."
madhav-panchamiya,7,"Dakota Johnson does justice to the role, worth a watch","There are too many negative reviews which isn't justified according to me. Yes, a few of the performances could have been better - but you are not supposed to apply logic to the powers of a superhero - just accept it. The plot is predictable, but enjoyable.Dakota Johnson as Madame Webb did justice to the role and personally, I would love to see her more in the Spider universe / inclusion in the MCU.Other performances wise - Sydney Sweeney was a little bit of a let down, the others were good though.The production value was good; CGI could be worked upon but not a deal breaker.All in all - MCU has had bigger let downs - and this movie is no where as bad as The Eternals or Ms Marvel. I rank this movie a little lower than the Black Widow movie which could have been great but missed the mark. But isn't a movie to miss out on.In the end - watch it - if you get the tickets at a good price or if it is available to stream."
KatyaPants,1,This movie is a crime,"I made the mistake of paying to see the latest atrocity committed by Sony.This movie is offensively boring and pointless. Do not watch this movie unless you like paying large corporations to insult your intelligence. Wait til it comes out on a streaming service.. anctually on second thought even then DONT BOTHER. I feel like I've been burgled. Why was this made? I am so confused. Is this a practical joke? I strongly feel that we deserve an explanation and a formal apology from sony. I also need to know how I can get a refund. I don't want the cinema to refund me, I WANT SONY TO REFUND ME. There isn't a single redeeming quality. I'm disappointed that I can't rate this movie lower than a one."
rachac,10,So so good! My boyfriend and I didn't want it to end!!,My boyfriend and I just finished watching this movie. We absolutely loved it!! It was so good we didn't want it to end! Dakota Johnson and the rest of the cast did amazing!!! We felt everything Dakota was giving in the film!! We hate that people are hating on this movie and Dakota when she absolutely killed it!!! Others just need to stop hating on her for branching out and stepping into a different role/character. Again SHE WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING and is with every role she does. We really like how the story line went in the movie and how you think you know what's coming or how it will end but it doesn't so there was always something keeping us on our toes. We just really hope to see a second movie! Loved it! Go watch it!
slydon13,7,The problem is the FEMALE energy,"I came to this film expecting to leave within minutes but I realized early on why so many of the regular 'Marvel' fans don't like this(1) there is a very female energy. When the lead is in a car chase, right from the start, she doesn't lead a path of destruction through the city. She is calm and collected which for me was refreshing but for men this must be disconcerting(2) Through out the film she doesn't want her super powers. While most male action 'heros' seek out powers, she is very reluctant about them. She wanted her old life back and that also must bother these men(3) Granted the scrip is dire in parts but there have been other Marvel scripts , just as bad. In fact , most of them are dire.(4) I LOVE when she just drives around in a crashed Yellow cab, like nobody would notice. Other marvel heros would turn that into a full movie of its own.(5) the baby shower scene - FINALLY a scene in a marvel movie I could relate to. Those 'girly' gigs are worse than the dentist - I would choose the dentist over a baby shower and Webb is a woman like me in that respect(6) I think the male movie goes just don't like all the women ganging up on that one man who wanted the regular global domination with super powers yada yada yada. Once again, made them uncomfortable. However as a female movie goer, I'm tired of the same old ding dong in movies. While the script and made teenage girls even more tedious than in Mean Girls, it was better than multi universe too many character BDE film."
arrowappledesign,1,I paid money to see this,"Coming off of the Spider-Man franchise with across the spider verse, I had high expectations because I personally have superhero fatigue. And for whatever reason, Spider-Man has never Fallen into this category until this movie. This movie was a blatant cash grab with no real direction and I do not know why it was greenlight as far as it was no pay off no characters of reconciliation or understanding. In fact, it doesn't even feel like a music video. Forgettable..................... why was Dakota Johnson in this? Doesn't she want to be considered a serious Hollywood actor Clickbait? It's not even Clickbait. This is just a straight up disaster of a movie with no intelligent people in storyboarding."
marston-51245,1,It's amazing how diabolically bad this is,"The only good fing is Sydney sweetie and it's not because of her acting as IndieWire says ""From its lack of stakes to its absence of style, and from its laughable CGI to its palpable discomfort with the rhythms and tropes of its genre, Madame Web is a superhero movie that feels like it was made by and for people who have never seen a modern superhero movie"". To put it bluntly this one of the worst movies ever and whoever made this should be banned from making movies as I went to the theater for 1h 54m and paid $22.85 including food to watch this disaster of a movie. Honestly if you want to go I recommend you go as it will give a new perspective on life as you realize how good other things are comparable to this movie."
benhabs-20207,1,I'm sorry Stan Lee,"I downloaded the IMDB app just to leave a review for this ""movie"" I only rated it a 1/10 because it won't let me go lower. I could write a review so long it puts war and peace to shame but I will get to the point. In the middle of watching this movie, in theaters, I audibly yelled ""WHY"" For several reasons. I wanted to kill myself just to put me out of the misery, and I couldn't believe I wasted my money on a ticket to this flaming pile of horse poop. I can't believe someone approved the idea of this movie and the only reason I, or anyone else in the theater made it out alive is because of the hope that maybe there would be a cameo, or a twist at the end that made the movie a little bit more bearable. Please don't watch this movie I hate myself for spending precious time on this."
gcsman,4,"There IS a way to watch this and enjoy it, but it calls for a certain mindset","Madame Web is indeed not too great, but I found a way to get some enjoyment out of it (without escaping into the obvious and unrewarding alternative of mockery). The way is to put yourself back in the mindset of roughly 25 years ago (which coincidentally is the time period the film is set in). Back then, superhero films were new -- think the first two Spiderman movies -- the superpowers were more specific and limited, the stakes were smaller, the stories were personal and kind of low-key compared with the present time. It was all fresh and new and started at a level you could believe. When you see it through that lens, there are things to enjoy. Dakota Johnson in the lead role is fine and she's on screen for almost every scene. The occasional 'Web vision' sequences are well done too, and the references to spiderweb patterns everywhere she looks are kind of clever.In other words: superhero movies don't have to be all Avengers-infinity-War level all the time with their universe-saving stakes, characters with godlike powers, and endless screen-melting battle scenes. The sequence starting with Iron Man (2008) and ending with Endgame (2019) was pretty amazing, but we might not see anything like it again. ""Ordinary superhero"" films can work too and we're in a different era.All that being said, Madame Web does have serious problems. The script and dialog are pretty uninspired -- like it passed through too many hands. The villain Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is cringeworthy, about as good as if he were doing a second rehearsal. The main plotline is that Cassie Webb (Johnson) is trying to save three young women who are going to become Spiderwomen (played by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor) from being brutally killed, a fate that she's seen with her precognitive power. But the action wanders and jumps around here and there and never feels like it settles on a coherent approach. Unfortunately, I would guess that these three young actresses are never going to get the chance to play their nascent Spiderwomen roles again. That's a shame, because there are some good storylines in that direction to work with.It's great that IMDb shows the viewer votes and not just thumbs-up or thumbs-down. But you really have to go beyond the average rating and look at the full bar graph of the actual votes (which you can see by clicking on the average rating at upper right on the screen). From the graph, you can see for yourself what the trollvote factor is (the bin at 1/10), discard it, and look at the REAL average from the rest. It's always obvious where the real center of the distribution is, and I usually find that I agree with it. I don't know if I've ever seen a movie that truly deserved a 1/10 and I don't think this one does either -- but despite some good elements, I can't rate it higher than about 4 or 5. And of course, there are way too many 'fans' out there who can't seem to stand superhero movies led by F rather than M protagonists and will not take these movie on their merits."

amandakelly-44326,2,Looked like a low budget movie with an MCU brand attached to it.,"Im a huge MCU fan, I saw how bad the reviews were but I know sometimes I can still really enjoy a movie even with bad reviews as long as its entertaining and has a great cast. Well this wasnt one of those.I wouldn't call the movie a disaster like people on here are describing it, but I wouldn't call it an amazing movie either, I know story lines are meant to be a little predictable but this one for some reason just wanted to really spell out the story line, not in a good way either.Would I watch this again, no, just seemed a little like a low budget film with MCU brand on it. Maybe the movie was done to set up the characters for the series in other MCU titles.Id say its the worst MCU movie Ive seen (and Ive seen all of them)"
FoxRush,6,It's Watchable and has some cool moments,"Okay I might be bias because it's Spider-Man related, but the movie literally wasn't that bad as people are saying. I would say its still more enjoyable then morbius. It's definitely not anything great. But it doesn't deserve the amount of hate it's getting. I see what they were trying to go for. And yes it may not have worked well. But the movie was still watchable and enjoyable. I did notice some weird edits and bad voice lines but other then little tid bits. It's not a bad movie. I will agree that they could have made it way better then what has released. I Really enjoyed the ""Spider-Man ripoff suit""that the villian used. I'm going to give it an 6/10."
seytancik,4,"Either made BY people with very low IQ's, or made FOR them.","The story had potential. That's why it is such a pity it turned out this way. I wouldn't even know where to start with the many, many things that are wrong with this movie.Just to highlight a few: it really seems like the script has been written bij toddlers. Of for toddlers, There are so many holes and goofs, that it is annoying. The dialogues sometimes hurt my intelligence and my ears. And then, there's the cast, who is simply not talented or charismatic enough to make up at least a little for the bad script. Especially Dakota Johnson and Sydney Sweeney didn't do their characters any good."
rannynm,8,"Full of action, mystery, suspense, sisterhood and girl power.","I love Madame Web. It is full of action, mystery, suspense, sisterhood and girl power. There are some heartfelt moments and the chemistry between the four leading ladies is outstanding. The film definitely kept me entertained from beginning to end.Madame Web tells the standalone origin story of one of Marvel's most enigmatic heroines. The suspense-driven thriller stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who develops the power to see the future and realizes she can use that insight to change it. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies if they can all survive a deadly present.I really loved learning who Madame Web is and how she became a heroine. I loved all the action scenes and watching the girls come together to fight against the villain Ezekiel. I loved seeing the girls in their costumes and the action was entertaining. The girls include Sydney Sweeney as Julia Cornwall, Celeste O'Connor as Mattie Franklin and Isabela Merced as Anya Corazon. The movie left me wanting more and hoping for a sequel so we can find out how the girls got their powers and what happens next! The chemistry between the four leading ladies is truly amazing. They work so well together and look like they are having so much fun together. Their friendship seems genuine on the screen. The battle scenes are epic, especially the last one when the girls work together and fight the villain Ezekiel.Madame Web is about teamwork, girl power, friendship, family, heart and action. It shows how friends will always be there for you, no matter what, and reminds you to always stay true to who you are. It is perfect for date night or a family movie night. Everyone will love it. The best part is that if you are a fan of Marvel movies, you don't have to see any previous movies to understand Madame Web. This movie stands alone with a phenomenal cast and great story line. It is rated PG-13 and it is 1 hour and 54 minutes.I give Madame Web 4 out 5 stars and I recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Madame Web is in theaters now. By Kennedy P., KIDS FIRST!"
tabitharoper,7,"I really enjoyed it, so Im glad I didnt go by the reviews here","My husband enjoys super hero movie, not me so much so my expectations weren't high. Wow was I surprised, I wasn't sure her laid back attitude would pull it off but thats what made it so well put together by the end- she needed to be cool, calm & methodical about the process. I really enjoyed it & enjoyed the way it came together 😁. I don't understand the bad reviews & Im glad I did go see it. The girls were fresh, fun, typical young girls, the dynamics were so different & theres a lot going on. There aren't that many super hero girls so it was refreshing for what it is & the humor was appreciated. I hope people give it a try🤷‍♀️"
cthirlby,2,Poor attempt,"I had little to no expectations for this film which is due to the trailer looking fan made. The cast was the one thing it had going for it as it had names to the film. I enjoyed parts where they incorporated comic book elements from the Madame Web story and put them into this such as the jungle and how her abilities worked. That's it. For a superhero movie the lack of actual superheros in the film is ridiculous, the girls who are spider women aren't in costume for very long, I appreciate the attention to detail with real suits and not CGI to make it look as close to characters as possible but it was barely a minute of content of that. It was a very messy movie and the action wasn't even that good. It consisted of her being confused by her abilities for half the movie and the villain chasing the girls round a lot back and fourth. The villain was really bad too, his motivation was essentially nothing and why he was defending himself and what he built so bad wasn't really explained at all. The suit for the villain was lazy too and was most likely a painted over Spider-Man suit as it looked exactly like Spider-Man but black and red. The plot for Ben Parker and others was just a whole messy thing that felt pointless and pretty sure was cut out of the film, if they kept that it probably would've been more interesting. The script really let this movie down the most, very bland and uninterested in itself with things being thrown everywhere. Overall not a good movie."
hamzasadeek,1,The worst Marvel movie and the worst superhero movie,"Firstly, there were technical problems with the character of Ezekiel, as his words did not match the movement of his lips, secondly, the story was not like the comics, thirdly, the acting was very poor and the scenes were very poor, and fourthly, the character, as long as Webb was not playing her role, and this movie made me guarantee that the movie Kraven the Hunter and Venom Part 3 They're going to be bad There was also one scene in which the characters were dancing to the song toxic, even though these were the events of 2002 and not 2003 And the main characters were of no use at all This film disappointed me greatly."
screenworm,3,It's a movie and all...,"As Disney has been bombarding us lately with some story- (screenplay-, character line-, CGI-, do we feel the need I go on?) lacking films I still was disappointed watching this movie.After 40 minutes passing, this film still had no storyline at all, information just kept flooding at you, ending after a whopping two hours. Yes, stuff blew up. Yes, people were wearing odd spider costumes, but is that really all they gave us?Some of the acts happening were quite confusing, yet I left the cinema with no bothers to raise questions at all. It didn't really matter. This movie doesn't really matter, it's just an option in case you're that bored."
levankvaracxelia,1,Don't watch it!,"Some people asked me: ""Was this movie as bad as everyone says?""My answer is yes. This movie was absolute garbage, The script was terrible, the dialogues were meaningless and stretched, the performance of the actors was very bad.And who the hell thought of casting Dakota Johnson in the lead role anyway? She is one of the worst actresses.I have seen all of the marvel movies since ""blade"" and this was the worst one even worse than ""Daredevil"" and ""Elektra"" movies.I thought ""Morbius"" was bad but after watching this, I realized that ""Morbius"" wasn't that bad.Don't watch this movie, waste your time on something else."
pdhemming,1,"Horrid, terrible nonsense","What a load of bullocks.It's just a mess. The acting is terrible, the plot is boring and predictable, action scenes are rubbish, characters are two dimensional to be kind.It's just awful, I don't know where to begin. The plot is basically some magic spiders and mystical tribe that does something with them. A mother trys to find them to solve a genetic issue with her unborn baby. Bad man takes the spider and because he stole the spider he is now cursed as the evil spider man. The baby is born with venom in the blood so has the ability to see future events.That's basically it. There's three teenage girls who are supose to get powers, but don't. And in the end the main character becomes some weird doctor x character in a wheelchair for no explained reason.It is stupid. It's a waste of my $12 I spent buying the ticket.Avoid this movie. It is the death of Marvel."
AziziOthmanMY,1,there's little to redeem this cinematic misfire.,"""Madame Web"" is a film that promised intrigue but delivered only disappointment. From its muddled plot to its lackluster performances, there's little to redeem this cinematic misfire.The story, if one can call it that, is a tangled web of confusion. It's as if the filmmakers threw every cliché and trope into a blender and hit ""puree."" There's no coherence, no logic, just a series of nonsensical events strung together in the hopes that the audience won't notice the lack of substance.The characters fare no better. Madame Web herself, supposedly the central figure of the film, is little more than a cardboard cutout with a few lines of dialogue thrown in for good measure. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, with performances ranging from wooden to downright cringeworthy.Visually, ""Madame Web"" is a snooze-fest. The special effects are laughably bad, with CGI that looks like it was lifted straight from a mid-90s video game. Action sequences are poorly choreographed, and even the most basic of stunts are executed with all the grace of a drunken elephant.In the end, ""Madame Web"" is a film that fails on every level. It's not entertaining, it's not thought-provoking, it's not even so bad it's good. It's just bad. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this cinematic disaster."
radioman99-705-745149,6,Hoped for better but...,"The main gripes here for me are the acting by the main antagonist. Often times it seemed he was dubbed poorly. The photography wasn't great and the snap zoom shots were justdirection. To the point of being annoying. The dialog was weak and the writing had a lot of problems. The conversations they had were very boring and sometimes added nothing to the film. The other actors did the best they could with what they were given. My hope is they do another with different writers, different directors, and better photography. The characters could be great if these factors are improved. THIS movie could have been better if these were improved even if they story wasn't changed."
dasa108,1,Stay away. Horrible.,"Greed sometimes makes you make bad decisions; Film production is full of bad options and worse films, demonstrating that the desire for huge profits does not guarantee massive success or public satisfaction. This film is the most radical demonstration of this precept. Those of us who grew up reading comics know that we must honor our characters (gender, race, ability). No one would dream of representing Napoleon as if he were Chinese or Jefferson as if he were Indian; They wouldn't show them as women either.... But with comic book characters the freedom is absolute and then Madame Webb is no longer an old invalid but a young woman with a story as uninteresting as that of my breakfast this morning. What happens next is one nonsense after another; It is a film without redemption, where even the villain competes with Dakota Johnson to see who is more disastrous. It is an incompetent film, without soul, without appeal or talent. Everything that happens is predictable, everything that happens lacks incentive to continue falling in love with this genre (superhero movies) that increasingly looks more exhausted thanks to the lack of ideas and the absolute absence of fidelity to the original material. It sucks, stay away from the film. You will thank me."
Bobtinin,6,Decent Movie,"Madame Web was a subpar B film, but nevertheless entertained me throughout. The movie probably would have been a lot better had they picked different writers instead of going with the Morbius team. Due to their choice, the end result was a story which was too scattered and not coherent enough. Another criticism would be with the monotonous delivery by the lead actress Dakota Johnson. With all that said, overall I've seen much worse movies than this which would legitimately merit the current 3/10 rating assigned to this movie. In my opinion, this movie should really be sitting at a 5.5/10 rating - but I will round up."
reachoutandsmack,1,So dumb,"The character Madame Web is a Marvel character as is Ezekiel the villain in this movie, but neither of them are remotely like the original characters. Madame Webb is an elderly woman in a wheel chair and Exekiel isn't a villain. So why use the names? I have no idea. This felt like an attempt to attract young men by dangling attractive women in tight suits but also pandering to women by making them 2 dimensional ""strong woman"" characters. Don't worry if you get the 3 younger women confused it really doesn't matter. At the end you will feel like you just watched a really long pilot of some bad 1980's action show."
pirekmatyas,1,I would describe simply... Random movie.,"I expected little from this movie, but I didn't expect that much. The movie itself was pretty empty and terribly random at one point there is something going on eventually it is mysteriously over and it builds to other random moments.The acting was spot on, sometimes I felt like I was watching a parody or an adult film (I'm thinking of Sydney Sweeney). A lot of the scene looked terribly artificial ""grilling"", which brings me back to the subtle Pepsi, Calvin Klein commercials.And now for the grand finale. If you've seen the trailer for the film like I have you probably have the same feeling I had when watching this film, the film was synonymous with the trailer and I mean that literally."

kjproulx,3,Messy and Dull,"I'm a huge fan of Marvel, whether you're talking about the MCU franchise or what other studios have done with the characters. For that reason, I'll always give each of them a chance. Upon hearing such awful things about Madame Web, I was worried but still open-minded. Well, I do believe certain critics are being a little too harsh on just how bad it is, but yes, it's not a good film at all. There are some nice ideas and a few positive things going for it, but as a whole, it all came down to the screenplay for me, which is easily the worst aspect here.The film follows Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) as she begins to gain the ability to see into the near future. This ability enables her to try and prevent people from dying, which comes in handy because a man by the name of Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) is after her and three other women, simply because he has had visions that they will murder him in the future. Julia (Sydney Sweeney), Anya (Isabela Merced), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor) round out the main cast, but never did I sense the chemistry between these three. Cassandra is the main character, but the film doesn't work if these other three characters aren't given anything to work with, which is exactly the case here.Instead of letting you experience the film and figure things out for yourself, this is a screenplay that spoon-feeds everything to you. After Cassandra discovers her abilities, the audience should easily understand how they work. Still, for some reason, lines of dialogue are said that literally express what she just did, even if she's the only one in the room. There are also far too many plot conveniences that make the story easier to tell and that just hurt my head. Each of the side characters has a similar backstory, which makes it easier for them all to be there and not have families worried about where they are. On top of that, either there was a lot cut out of this film, or there were a lot of bizarre editing choices. Either way, Madame Web felt slow, rushed, messy, and disjointed all at once.I enjoyed the dead-pan performance from Dakota Johnson though. Her line delivery, even with the poor dialogue, was enjoyable to me. The villain storyline could have been interesting as well, it's just that the performance by Rahim feels very wooden and it was obvious that they changed his dialogue in post-production. The ADR work here is very much visible. Look, I'm a huge Spider-Man fan, so I'll be watching anything that's related, but I just can't recommend this one at all. There are a few moments that got a chuckle out of me and I liked the central performance, but other than that, Madame Web is a failure."
harishnj,3,"Decent screenplay, but the film needs more","Madame Web introduces a fresh character to the superhero universe, but the film itself plays it safe. The screenplay offers some decent moments, but overall, it feels like a missed opportunity. There's potential here, yet the execution leaves it feeling just okay. It's still a watchable film if you're a fan of the genre. However, don't expect a groundbreaking addition to the Spider-Verse; Madame Web ultimately settles for a predictable formula. Dakota Johnson delivers a solid performance as Cassandra Webb, but the supporting cast feels underdeveloped. The film's visuals are occasionally striking, but lack the distinct style that could have elevated the material. While there are hints of a more compelling story, Madame Web never quite finds its footing."
axxmqmcy,3,Why?,"Despite countless past experiences, I continually watch these movies with hopeful anticipation, only to later regret my decision. This was definitely one of those regrets. The entire movie was gratuitous, poorly written and even more poorly acted.I will forever question why the studios continue to pay Dakota Johnson for her ""acting"" as her entire performance feels uncomfortable.This movie was a whole lot of cheesy cgi thrown together with a sub-par plot that made the whole thing feel like it was comprised of scraps picked off the cutting room floor and thrown together for a 116 minute-long headache.I don't look for this to have a sequel or a franchise and if it were, I will definitely avoid subjecting myself to it."
N0T_Y0U,6,Top 3 Arrowverse pilots,"IMO, this is one of the top 3 Arrowverse pilots, I think Berlanti did a decent job on this. Team Web was pretty cool, and I can't wait to see what they do in the upcoming season. I believe watching young Peter group up over the next few years is going to add something to the series, because we never really got to see Richard and Mary in different iterations of Spidey. Perhaps they will give him his powers earlier and we can watch him train with team Web. I really hope they add this show to the next Arrowverse crossover and not do it dirty like Black Lightening and Stargirl. Great job CW, I look forward to this series meeting Superman and Lois!"
AfricanBro,3,Sony's Spiderverse without Spiderman lol.,"So some spoilers, but also you really don't need to go see this movie. Very forgettable. The whole movie is its own spoiler alert. It was predictable in a weird way, the movie reveals in one way or another, what's gonna happen next. And I don't mean Madam Web's visions. For instance the background story in the movie's opening scene, you know know what the main characters connection is and that she's gonna return. You know about the villain and you know who Dakota's character meets. You figure all this at the start of the movie. And then outside of the opening scene, because the narrative lacks complexity and follows a formulaic superhero plot, it's easy to anticipate how the movie ends. Plus, characters often explicitly narrate their situations, further diminishing any element of surprise. Like there's absolutely nothing that surprises you in this movie.Everybody in this movie looked like they knew they weren't making a great movie. The writing was abysmal. It made all the actors look like it's their first time acting. I think Dakota Johnson is a pretty big name, and Sydney Sweeney is a hot topic in Hollywood right now, so I'm wondering how they managed to convince them to be in this.The three girls parents being out of the picture felt too convenient for the movie plot. Still wasn't explained how the three girls were connected, like how and why do they become spider-women? Like really, why and how? There's a scene where Dakota Johnson tells the French spider dude that his visions were actually about her, and not the three girls. So this dude really just vividly imagined these three girls faces, in so much detail he could scan their face on NSA federal database and find them? Exact match. Lol. And the villain in a spider man costume, this is Sony really trying to keep hold of Spider-Man man.Also the movie's story wasn't that interesting, and neither were the characters. I didn't really care for any of them. I heard madam web is a side character and the villain isn't a villain in the comics. The three girls in the movie were were just some damsels in distress. They didn't have any depth, all you learn about them of substance is in be line of dialogue. 1-My dad is deported, mum's dead. 2-my parents are never home, they in china. 3-my mums crazy, my dad's new family don't like me. Felt like these girls just existed only to be rescued.A few notes: I did laugh at the 'climbing a wall' scene. The spider men in the trees looked horrible. Scenery was colorful and vibrant at times. Cassie didnt look wet under water, it just looked like she's in zero gravity. A lot of upside-down flipped scenes. Also, there's so little super-heroism in this, I saw a bunch of posters showing the three girls in costumes, but i don't think we get to see them in that for more than sixty seconds, in total.First time since moving to America I've seen a new movie based in New York. So for some parts in the movie, I got excited like oh wow, I've been there, I know the spot. I've been in the train to Mt Vernon. The train sequence was however, when I started getting bored. Felt like it was dragging forever and yet it's the scene that's probably supposed to draw you in, when the action starts and the villain is revealed to the protagonists. When the action kicks off.Despite all that I didn't hate it so much. When it comes to how bad movies can be, at 1/10 star rating is Bruce Willis' Cosmic Sin and Morgan Freeman's Vanquish. And this was as bad as those. It was just mainly dull. I wasn't expecting anything great, so I didn't dislike it as much. In terms of reality vs expectation, I ""enjoyed"" this more than I did secret invasion. But I don't think either of the two are anything close to being good."
lorenzorolli-35025,8,It's not that bad,"Before I saw the film I heard some people said that it was the ""worst superhero movie ever made"",but when I saw i appreciate the film.Ok, is not the best movie, but I think not all the people understood that it is collocated in the 2003 so, it told about the past not the present.I appreciate the trama, is not that worst, but a thing that I don't like is that we don't know if the villain will return and we will see the fight between the new female superheroes and the villain and what end has made the persone that help the villain?I would see a sequel seeing the development of the characters in the present."
relampago-56516,7,Madame Web: A Web of Intrigue and Deja Vu,"The latest cinematic venture into the Marvel universe, ""Madame Web,"" presents itself as a perplexing yet intriguing puzzle. At first glance, the movie delivers a solid performance, weaving a complex narrative that challenges the viewer's perception with its clever use of deja vu scenes and intricate plot developments. This bold attempt at depicting the elusive phenomenon of deja vu might leave some audiences feeling bewildered and, at times, frustrated, as if caught in a web of confusion. One can't help but empathize with the filmmakers' daunting task of translating such an abstract concept onto the screen-envisioning themselves in the director's chair, grappling with the question, ""How do we visually articulate this experience?""Marvel movies are no strangers to experimenting with narrative techniques aimed at bending the viewer's mind, often culminating in blockbuster hits. However, ""Madame Web"" treads a fine line, occasionally stumbling into repetition and monotony that might not sit well with everyone. This has led to a mixed reception, with some critics quick to point out its flaws.Yet, upon reflecting on the movie as a whole, a realization dawns-the seemingly disjointed pieces fit together in a way that makes perfect sense, offering a satisfying resolution to the initially puzzling journey. While ""Madame Web"" may not ascend to the heights of Marvel's most iconic films, it holds its ground with a commendable effort. It's a movie that merits a 7/10, worth watching once with a bucket of popcorn in hand, and appreciating it as an origin story that adds another layer to the Marvel tapestry. Here's hoping the characters introduced find their way back into the Marvel storyline in future projects, further unraveling the mysteries they've begun to explore."
raydavis-96452,1,Complete waste,"In all of my years of rating movies I've never given a movie of one, but this movie completely takes the cake. The concept in the writing of this movie could have been a lot better, because the thought of having a Madame Web movie could have been quite suitable for Sony, but I don't know what group of elementary students are junior high students they got together to write this movie it was completely garbage. One thing I don't understand is that there were a lot of great actors in this movie but they were completely used the wrong way as of contributing to it a Marvel/ Sony movie. I can honestly say I think this is one of the worst Marvel movies that I've ever seen, and I am pretty good with giving Marvel movies their props, as well as Sony but this movie was completely a waste of time. I'm kind of frustrated that I actually waste time to sit here and watch it."
ucladude1,4,3.8? Hmm,"Did you really like the previews? I did. Was surprised to see people dumping on them on Facebook ads. Not sure what their problems were.Seeing 3.8, I read reviews. It felt like it could be similar. Some people dig and some people don't for whatever reasons.The higher ratings motivated me. I dug the previews, so this movie will vibe with me.It was a little interesting in the beginning. Problem is the story is SLOPPY. There is very little connection. Things just kind of happen and without any pre-text or post-text.Not so terrible that I want to leave the theatre, but honestly have lowest expectations. But, if you don't stay, you never know!Stayed and whatever. None of it mattered. And I am not going to see the next one."
joydeepnath1,4,This is probably the worst movie from Sony,"""My initial query is, how could a distinguished production house like Sony/Columbia Pictures produce a movie of such poor quality? The entire film was disappointing, with subpar acting, a lackluster storyline, and unsatisfactory visual effects. It seemed as though the actors were merely participating for the paycheck, with no real passion for their roles. The director appeared to rush the storytelling, failing to weave the narrative effectively. It's as if this movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was a regrettable waste of time, and it's been a while since I've seen a film this disappointing."""
dkhwnzf,2,Sony dropped the ball again.,"Madam Web, a character in the Marvel Comics universe, fails to captivate audiences with her lackluster and uninspiring presence. Introduced as a clairvoyant with ties to the mystical, her potential is squandered by inconsistent storytelling and a failure to establish a compelling narrative around her.One of the primary issues with Madam Web is the ambiguity surrounding her origins and powers. Instead of providing a clear and engaging backstory, the character is shrouded in mystery to the point of confusion. This lack of development leaves audiences detached, struggling to invest in a character that remains enigmatic without purpose.Furthermore, Madam Web's role within the Marvel universe feels forced and inconsequential. Despite being positioned as a key figure, she often comes across as a mere plot device rather than a fully fleshed-out character with agency and depth. The narrative fails to explore her potential impact on the larger Marvel landscape, rendering her existence seemingly arbitrary.The character's visual representation also falls short of expectations. Madam Web's design lacks the creativity and distinctiveness that define iconic Marvel characters. Her costume and appearance feel generic, failing to leave a lasting visual impression that would make her stand out among the plethora of superheroes and villains within the Marvel universe.Narratively, Madam Web's involvement in various story arcs often feels like an afterthought. Writers struggle to integrate her seamlessly into overarching plots, leading to disjointed storytelling that detracts from the overall cohesion of the comic series. This lack of narrative integration leaves Madam Web feeling like a superfluous addition rather than a meaningful contribution to the Marvel mythos.Moreover, Madam Web's powers, centered around precognition, become a repetitive narrative device. The constant reliance on her ability to foresee events diminishes the element of surprise and suspense in the storytelling, making her appearances predictable and, ultimately, monotonous."
bialislaw-855-415023,3,Abysmally wasted potential...,"Going into this, I knew the popular opinion about the movie but I like to form my own ones and never base anything on crowd mentality. Sadly I've come to share in that opinion unfortunately...People may wonder, how did this get the money for production. That's simple - PR. World wants more female-driven movies and a better portrayal of strong women which in 2024 equals a female-superhero movie. Studios greenlight whatever has the most women archetype-slaying and 'badassery' potential without any consideration for how bad it can turn out to be.The result is.... well, this movie, I guess.The idea behind the movie was sound and there was significant potential to be explored. However the list of everything wrong, mishandled or flat out dumb is longer that I'd ever care to write here. Other reviews paint a pretty accurate picture in that regard.Don't get me wrong, I love strong female protagonists but this is not the way to do it MARVEL...Also, punch-in zooms??? What is this, a reality TV show?"
holliejolly,4,It's...not great,"Ok so I love female lead superhero movies and was excited for this one. The trailer looked intriguing. I always ignore critic reviews and make up my own mind. But damn, this movie was confused. The opening scenes felt forced but then the first half of the movie actually had some potential. The problem is it is never really gets realised. I liked the first couple scenes exploring clairvoyance but there is no character growth and you are constantly waiting for action that never really materialises until the big stupid cgi end battle with ludicrous physics and oh, now Madame Web can suddenly use her other powers having never practiced them at any point earlier in the movie. Then the extra strong bad guy gets taken out in an extremely lame anticlimactic way and we finish with some of the most cringe sequel baiting I've ever scene.All that being said I think this movie's biggest problem is in its editing. The pacing is off and you notice, frequently. A lot of scenes feel either unfinished or you feel like you've come in late and missed something. You haven't, either the work just wasn't put in to the script or it somehow was left on the editing room floor. It is a mess.Don't get me wrong, some of the movie is enjoyable and it is watchable. But don't expect great things. It's mediocre at best."
mccuack,6,Lack of meaning,"I don't think the movie is bad per-se, I saw worse (X-men Apocalypse, Dark Phoenix). It looks like a movie to start or connect to 'something' (obviously Spider-verse), but it ends with the sensation that this is all... if these characters, ended in a main line of Marvel, this movie won't contribute ANYTHING to that line, not even to explain where their powers (if any) come from, except for the main character. For me, this is the problem of this movie, pretend to be an introduction movie for some characters and it fails on it. For instance Venom is quite independent, and just with a post-credit the movie can enter in the MCU."
parrishken,2,"Unfortunately, have to agree with bad reviews","What am I wasting money for on AMC A-List? There are few and far in-between good movies being made that are worth my time and money. Madame Web was definitely NOT a good movie. We did a back to back movie day and this was our 1st movie, in which I almost fell alseep. The 2nd movie, I think titled ""Land of Bad"" was soooooo much better with storyline and overall quality. Going forward, we'll spend our money elsewhere. The streaming services have better movies than this crap. Besides which, it seemed to be more designed for the teen crowd. It's just sad that these big name movie studios have gotten so bad."
pdxqraj,9,Why All the Hate,"I like the movie. It's compelling due to the interwoven sci-fi aspect that carries the narrative. While I wish some of the beats were further fleshed out, it's not as bad as some of the other reviewers have claimed. A good rating for this movie would be around 6.5, so I gave it a 9 to outweigh the overwhelming amount of negative dissertations.Frankly, I think the downvoting is a mix of misogyny, hate against Sony and abysmal disdain for anything that promotes diversity and inclusion. How dare Sony make a superhero movie with real life issues and implications? I'm always for representation in all genres."
george-ghiu,6,I don't understand the HATE towards this film !,"Ok, this is not a masterpiece like some Marvel films, but it's also not the worst movie out there. It's watchable. I guess the hate here is more for Dakota Johnson, who after being cast in the Fifty shades films, some people don't take her seriously enough to have a major role as a superhero. She doesn't seem to have a strong chemistry with the other actresses for most of this film, but the end shows a different picture. The story is not bad, but definitely needs more work.Half of the film is chaotic, not giving enough background and there isn't a natural flow between moments. It looks a lot like a compilation of highly edited scenes put together as a movie. The replay of some moments in the film might put some people off. I just found it funny and as a way to lead to more significant scenes.The pluses on this film seem to be the soundtrack, having some important names in the cast and portraying feminist ideas like women can be badass superheroes as well. Guess people don't want to see that ?! Or are not ready !There's no after credits scenes so don't stay in the cinema after credits start !I think this is a 6/10 film and hope there will be more instalments of Madame Web, in which the producers, directors and the cast can do a better job and get better reviews and recognition!"
dlk2677,3,Wow this is BAD!,"The first 30 minutes were promising and then it all went down hill.The movie was written by the writers of Gods of Egypt, Morbius and Power Rangers. Morbius is better than this mess and that should say it all.They built Cassie up to be this loner who keeps everyone (even friends) at a distance. Then all of the sudden, completely out of character, she decides to save three entitled, disrespectful, rude brats...excuse me teenagers. They weren't grateful, they weren't thankful, never listened.In the middle of the danger Cassie takes a super quick trip to the Amazon. No plan, no shots/vaccinations, no problem, 7 day turn around. Complete suspension of reality is needed.I get they were hoping for a Madame Webb 2 but this heaping pile of garbage needs to be taken to the curb with the recycling.The writing is absolutely atrocious. The acting is terrible. The main characters (4 girls especially the 3 younger ones) are absolutely unlikable. Please do not make another."
eziukwuuprightness,5,A Brilliant Flop,"""Madame Web"" surprisingly rises above the expectations set by its awkward trailer and its release in the often-dubious month of February.This film is centered around a refreshingly low-key superhero story, Dakota Johnson shines with her captivating performance. Directed by S. J. Clarkson, known for her work in television, the movie ventures into visually overwhelming territory towards its climax, peppered with dialogue that often feels a bit heavy-handed. Yet, there's a charm in how Johnson's character, Cassie Webb, navigates through the peculiar events unfolding around her, her frustration visibly mounting as she tries to make sense of it all.In a particularly gripping moment, Cassie finds herself with literal blood on her hands, foreseeing a death but at a loss on how to stop it. This concept of revisiting events to alter outcomes isn't new-we've seen it in films from ""Groundhog Day"" to ""Happy Death Day."" However, ""Madame Web"" explores these familiar grounds in engaging new ways.Johnson's mastery in delivering dry, witty remarks breathes life into the film, making you long for more scenes of her character dealing with troublesome teenagers with a steadily growing impatience. Her portrayal adds a down-to-earth flair to the superhero genre.Although Sweeney, Merced, and O'Connor are somewhat pigeonholed into simplistic roles, and believably playing high school students stretches the imagination, the group dynamic they share with Johnson adds a layer of enjoyable camaraderie to the mix.A 5/10 movie in my books.

Josephpr1990,4,Not very good,"My friend and I saw this at the Cineworld Dublin in March 2024. We thought it was great but it's not very good as other Marvel films especially Sony's Spiderman series. It's kinda bland and mediocre. It doesn't even make any sense to me at all. Frankly I'd say it's definitely more than just being an action film.I don't know why Sony made this dull Marvel film.It's probably one of the worst superhero films of all time.I'll just have to totally forget about it and move on.If you're reading this, don't attempt to waste your money on this rubbish on DVD nor Blu-Ray. Avoid it as you would a bullet.Go and watch Spiderman (especially the Tobey Maguire ones) instead."
jaszboy,1,Couldn't rate it less than 1,"I wanted to find out why this film bombed, and the reviews do not lie, it's terrible but watch it with friends for a laugh. We defiantly had a good laugh. Think of the film like 'The Room' but on a bigger budget, filled with an empty dialogue, unnecessary pauses, massive cliches every 10 mins and awkward queues. The timeline is set in 2003 yet some of them have high tech computers, consistently inconsistent. I was hoping for a better job out of Sydney Sweeny but they gave her the clueless character role once again. That said, this will go down in history as one of those bad films to watch in the future."
jerett-lacure,1,How the Mavel universe has fallen,From the start looks like a low budget spoof. This can't really be part of the marvel universe can it. I don't know what else to say about this trash film to met the minimum characters for a review. IMBD needs to lower the character count for movies that don't deserve reviews like this one. I'll just copy and past the above review. So this is the end. From the start looks like a low budget spoof. This can't really be part of the marvel universe can it. I don't know what else to say about this trash film to met the minimum characters for a review. Wow that still wasn't enough characters. Only one remaining.
MB-reviewer185,3,Her web connects them all,"I do know the basics on Madame Web's backstory in the comics and what her powers are, along with her having a major role in multiple Spider-Man comics that tend to involve the Spider-Verse; I know all the hate for the Marvel movies associated with Sony and the Spider-Man universe they are making, involving their past Spider-Man spinoff films like the Venom films and the Morbius film, so it makes sense why people are not that big on a Madame Web movie. The movie Madame Web (2024) was disappointing because it had potential to make a cool and interesting movie on an interesting Marvel character, but instead it felt like a missed opportunity, especially since the main premise is just the Terminator story put into a Spider-Man movie; the movie is between having decent and bad acting, it has poor script, it tends to not make sense, its characters are not that developed, and mediocre CGI.I know there are people who do not like Dakota Johnson because of past movies she has been in, but she was not bad in the role of Cassandra Webb/Madame Web, she just did not have that good a script to work off to make the character likable or interesting, along with her working as a paramedic having little interest for saving these three girls throughout the film; she has an occasional line that could be funny because of her dry humor, but overall she is just trying her best to make it work. The three girls Julia Cornwall, Anya CorazÃ³n, and Mattie Franklin, played ok by Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor, all got annoying from time to time with them not listening to Cassandra Webb and just doing dumb things that get them in trouble; they each have a little bit of backstory, but it is rushed by, and we just go off of the fact that they become heroes like Spider-Man in the future. The last thing I will say about Cassandra Webb/Madame Web and the three girls is that they had little to no chemistry with one another, so I could not connect with them as much as I wanted to while they are trying to protect themselves from the main villain.The main villain named Ezekiel Sims was not played that great by Tahar Rahim, with this villain having a connection to Cassandra Webb's mother back in the day, there is not much backstory about why he is trying to kill the three main girls, except because they become spider people in the future and kill him while also not giving a reason why they would kill him; almost all of his lines of dialogue were obviously bad ADR and did not match up with his lip movements, and he has this Spider-Man looking suit that looks a bit silly and comes out of nowhere in random sequences. Ben and Mary Parker played by Adam Scott and Emma Roberts are not bad in the movie, but they are not in the movie that much and they do very little, except give us references to Spider-Man and how his life might go in the future; this can be annoying by how in your face it can be, especially since there are moments that were supposed to have a Spider-Man reference in it but was cut/edited out, either have no references to the character or have references that are not awkward.The script was poorly put together with a lot of bad lines of dialogue making scenes awkward, especially since you are not attached to the characters that much, and there are lots of scenes in the movie that do not make sense; there are moments that are awkward and slow because these moments did not need to happen, along with there being moments where the main characters make dumb decisions leading to trouble with the villain finding them in some way, along with there being lots of scenes in the movie that does not match the previous scenes it showed with a different vibe. There are a few sequences in the movie I thought was not bad, and occasionally an action scene can be good enough with its occasional ok CGI effects; the way Cassandra Webb uses her abilities was not bad, though it could have had better ways to show how she sees the future, and Cassandra's backstory involving a jungle in Peru, a spider that gives you powers, and a weird clan of spider people was interesting but made no sense at certain parts of the movie when you really think about it.If you did not care for any of Sony's other Spider-Man spinoffs, then this movie will not win you over, and I can understand why this movie was hated by lots of people; the movie Madame Web (2024) has decent performances from the lead stars, a bad performance from the villain, ok CGI and action, dumb scenes and scenes that make no sense, and mostly nothing that we saw was explained that well, along with it having a badly put together script with bad lines of dialogue. All I will say is that the movie was not good, but it was not completely awful, it has an occasional good action sequence and some interesting ideas that should have been explored more; not an awful movie, but I did think it was an extremely disappointing movie."
badboyjeff31,7,"Expecting the worst, pleasantly surprised","So I went in after reading all the bad reviews on this. From the voice overs in certain parts to some complaints of minor action sequences, I will tell you that it may have helped me really enjoy this movie! Much like skinamarink(which I detested) there may be mixed reviews. Madame web was interesting to me, Equal parts Final destination and Spider-man it was interesting to see how many non powered individuals would survive with only Madame webs precognition and problem solving to avoid the bleak future they all may have to face. I will watch this again over a slew of othe Marvel and DC movies I already own."
Prismark10,3,Madame Web,"British director SJ Clarkson has done respectable work for both British and American television. Shows such as Spooks, Hustle and Heroes.She becomes unstuck with Madame Web, the fault lies mostly with a lousy script.Sony celebrating its 100th year stubbornly continues with the Spiderverse. They just keep on hiring rubbish screenwriters.It starts in 1973 when pregnant Constance Webb searches for a rare species of spider with special healing powers in Peru. Only to be betrayed by her guide Ezekiel Sims who steals the spider and leaves Constance for dead.Her baby is saved by the people of the forest and their amazing powers but Constance dies.In 2003, Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is a paramedic in New York. A near death experience gives Cassie and ability to see future events and change it.She uses these powers to save three young women on a subway train. Julia Cornwall, Anya Corazon and Mattie Franklin. They are being pursued by Ezekiel Sims who now possesses spider like powers and regards these women as dangerous to him.Madame Web wants to be a female led superhero movie under the Sony/Marvel banner. It totally lost it when the three women walk out of the forest, straight into a nearby diner and start dancing on a table. Thereby attracting attention when Cassie has warned them to stay hidden.If the writers want to insult the intelligence of their audience that is a matter for them. They should not expect respect or a box office ticket in return."
brentstansfield,8,Why is this rated so low....,"I thought the acting was good if not great. Most of the scenes seemed to be shot without the use of blue screen, the plot was good, not your typical Superhero Plot, but more intimate. The girls acting around the main character were professional. I really liked this movie because it was not your stereo typical Superhero movie. While not a huge fan of spiders, the way the first flashback scenes tied the whole movie together was great. The fight scenes were believable, and the bad guy was also good in another way that tied the movie together as a whole. So why such a low review rating? Did nobody else watch this movie, or if they did perhaps they skipped giving it a rating? Whatever the reason, I liked this movie and would tell others to ignore the rating and give it a try, I think it's a pretty good movie."
andrewchristianjr,6,OVERACTED.,"Took a while to get started but never really delivered. The story falls flat every time it tries to pick up. Overacted, felt dubbed and unintentionally corny. Poorly executed and forced.Synopsis;
In a switch from the typical genre, Madame Web tells the standalone origin story of one of Marvel publishing's most enigmatic heroines. The suspense-driven thriller stars Dakota Johnson as Cassandra Webb, a paramedic in Manhattan who develops the power to see the future... and realizes she can use that insight to change it. Forced to confront revelations about her past, she forges a relationship with three young women bound for powerful destinies... if they can all survive a deadly present."
czfzsv,2,I'm glad I waited to watch it till it was 2.99 for rental.,"This was a whole hodge splodge of bulls**t. I am still tryna figure out what I saw. For a movie that was about women becoming theme selves it dove a lot into how they looked and where the heck were the powers.I'll say the music choices were pretty solid
And their was one emotional part in this movie - it happens when she travels to the jungle that's all ima say do I don't spoil the only emotional part in this film.All the good stuff was spoiled through/thanks to the trailers. The ending fight scene was actual what saved me from brining the rating down to a 1 and or no rating. It was pretty entertaining the last fight scene it was fun and enjoyable."
gunmasterg9,1,I think the director and writer got caught up in webs when writing this,"40 mins is all I managed and that too after skipping some boring parts. If the film doesn't get hold of you maximum in 10 / 15 mins then it does not succeed. Dakota Johnson has no screen presence. Even the CGI spider had more presence.Sony should give all Spiderman properties over to Marvel rather than try with these mediocre movies such as Venom 2, Morbius and now this utter piece of rubbish.Even the 3.8 or whatever the rating is on IMDB is being generous to this. That's 40 odd mins of my life I could not get back, it was so bad I switched it off and starting watching an Episode of Blue Blood on Paramount Plus."
sankywankar,5,Look like forcefully superhero create,"This movie combination of 4 superheroStart with spiderman + doctor strange + daredevil + professor X.Movie start with good story line but middle story trying to make forcefully new superheros and also one strongest superhero.Ending story we know many new super heros coming with same abilities,Which is not worthy,First marvel movie have superheros with one man or women with one quality or ability but now marvel trying create many abilities in one and some are same power as before movies heroes .We love spiderman movies ,we also love conceptBut now we thinking marvel what trying to do or showing us is more powerfull
Spider man or this web character."
tayumethemuffinman,2,Utterly inept,"It baffles me how a movie this incompetent in its execution of everything in it exists.Me and my gf both went to go see it in theaters (don't worry, we got in for free because we worked there. I still feel robbed). It felt like they got someone who had never seen a movie in their life, and told them to direct, write, and edit the thing, while holding them and their family hostage.Dakota Johnson's performance flipflopped between a severely autistic woman or a complete sociopath. I half expected Jacket from Hotline Miami to walk into frame and ask, ""Do you like hurting other people?""The side characters were about as deep and complex as a pack of chicken nuggets from McDonald's. Their personalities boiled down to delinquent, schoolgirl, and illegal immigrant, with the only thing they had in common was that their parents sucked.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this movie to a living, functioning human being. I could've stared at my dog for two hours and gotten a more enthralling experience."
derrickdavis-76256,5,An undercooked meal that should have been cooked longer,From the start it was predictable on what was going to happen. And it was all over the place as wellThe whole movie seemed rushed and the script was ungenuine and reminded me of a quick money scheme.The point of these movies in my opinion should be set up for Marvel history that can build off the storyline years from now.The actors in this movie are great actors and its a shame they didn't get the opportunity to properly develop their characters IMO.The Villain was not believable. We have been introduced to some nasty Villains in the Marvel globe he was as believable as Santa Clause to a teen.
aldrash-88047,6,Why do people hate it so much?,"Before I start, I have to say I'm not a superhero movie fan at all. Anytime my friends have dragged me to watch a Marvel movie, I've either disliked it or hated it. So maybe my expectations weren't very high for this one, yet I enjoyed it.It's not a super deep or extremely well written movie (most characters are lacking enough depth or background for the viewer to care or understand them), but the concept is interesting and original and it led to a few exciting scenes. Some dialogues are quite poor, but the acting isn't as bad as people say. The CGI is, it threw me off a couple times. The music was really well chosen and the movie fulfills its purpose: it's very entertaining.Not sure what masterpieces people are used to. I know it's not the movie of the year, but if I enjoyed it being (kinda) a superhero movie hater, fans of this genre will probably find a few things to enjoy in this movie!"
zardoz-13,4,Madame Web Is Nothing Marvelous,"Dakota Johnson can foretell the future in freshman director S. J. Clarkson's sophomoric ""Spider-Man"" spinoff prequel ""Madame Web,"" but she struggles to understand and make the best use of her unusual supernatural gifts. Cassie's mom Constance (Kerry Bishé of ""Argo"") gave birth to her daughter while she was scouring the jungles of Peru in 1973 for a rare but exotic spider whose venom has incredible healing powers. Constance's treacherous guide who has accompanied her during her research, Ezekiel Sims ( Tatar Rahim of ""Napoleon""), steals her research along with one of these unique spiders. He guns down Constance's three lab assistants and when she refuses to hand over the spider, Ezekiel shoots her. Predictably, ill-fated Constance is dying when an enigmatic tribe of tree people known only as Las Arañas or ""mythical spider people who run across the treetops"" keep Constance alive long enough to give birth to Cassie. Later, we learn the Aranas guys used one of those spiders on Constance that would save Cassie's life. Constance discovered the healing properties of these mysterious spiders and sought them out to save her daughter who had been diagnosed with a rare, incurable disease.Fast forwarding to 2003, our pretty, dark-haired heroine Cassie lives alone in an apartment in Queens in New York City with a stray cat and maintains a low profile. Guess who else in the Marvel Universe grew up in Queens? Anyway, she works as a paramedic alongside none other than Ben Parker (Adam Scott of ""Leap Year"") and his sister is Mary Parker (Emma Roberts of ""Scream 4""). One day Cassie has a near death experience that unlocks her power. Accidentally trapped in a wrecked car that plunges into the East River, Cassie awakens those powers long dormant in her DNA. She survives the plunge because Ben rescued her from the river. Now, she starts having baffling episodes of what she imagines is déjà vu. Actually, she realizes she can predict the future because she can see things happen literally before they occur.The shamelessly contrived screenplay, penned by ""Morbius"" scribes Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless with rewriters courtesy of Claire Parker and Clarkson, features banal dialogue, cardboard characters, and lackluster spectacle. Mind you, Johnson lends a modicum gravity to these preposterous shenanigans which have her running interference for three cute teens, Julia (Sydney Sweeney of ""Anyone But You""), Anya (Isabela Merced of ""Instant Family""), and Mattie (Celeste O'Connor of ""Freaky"") who have been earmarked for death by the creepy villain. The parents of these girls had no use for them, have abandoned them, and left them to their own fates. Eventually, this threesome will emerge as a crime busting trio.Every superhero saga must have a dastardly villain. The nefarious Ezekiel, who runs around the Big Apple in his bare feet, has been haunted by the specter of these three girls decked out in Spider-man outfits in his recurring nightmares. Like Cassie, Ezekiel can see into the future, and these dames represent a clear and present danger to his future. He decides to kill them before they mature into crime busting superheroines, so he acquires some devastating NSA cyber gear that enables an accomplice to locate these three girls before they embark on their own superheroine crusade. Basically, Ezekiel's video equipment can scan every face in New York City and locate these gals if a video camera captures and records them. When Cassie experiences her first bout of foreseeing the future, she is riding on the same subway train that Julia, Anya, and Mattie have boarded. Cassie sees Ezekiel kill them individually and hustles the reluctant teens off the train. They cannot explain Ezekiel's surreal ability to climb upside down on ceilings and leap from one car to another car on heavily trafficked city streets. According to Cassie, Ezekiel has superhuman powers that enable him to kill humans by merely touching them.Columbia Pictures, owned by Sony, has the rights to Marvel's ""Spider-man"" franchise, and they are exploiting anything and everything that lies within Spidey's universe. Earlier, they came up Tom Hardy as ""Venom,"" but ""Madame Web"" lacks the charisma of the ""Venom"" movies. Comparatively speaking, the half dozen or more déjà vu episodes in ""Madame Web"" are reminiscent of white-knuckled thrillers like ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Final Destination"" and both ""Happy Death Day"" movies. This 116-minute melodrama shoves so much down your throat that you may miss some of the allusions of ""Spider-Man."" Spider webs are designed to trap their prey, but what little spectacle that ""Madame Web"" spins doesn't strand a chance in the long run."
sillimion,10,Great acting and entertaining!,I have to start with saying that this movie does not deserve all the bad reviews. I'm thinking it's because of the same reason why The marvels got bad reviews... Now what could that be?This movie was so entertaining and suspenseful. I was sitting on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. The action was good too and the acting amazing. I hope at least someone sees this review and gives it a chance and also not think it's bad just because so many have felt the need to share their thoughts in that direction. Feel free to not like stuff but please don't bring those things down because of it.Definitely would watch again!
danagnorisis,6,It's not THAT bad. And what a shame for the franchise...,"Im going to try and keep this review succinct. This is not a bad film. It's not a Marvel hit, and it certainly has plenty of plotholes. But it's not that bad. Certainly not as bad as Morbius.It's very common these days for the bandwagon to get set on fire. It such a shame. This was obiviously the start of a saga, maybe a triology, but i doubt with the critics reviews and the following backlash we will ever see that now. Sure it doesn't fit 100% with the timeline but.. duh.. Spiderman Far From Home? Jees, we all ignored that one. But the momentum of these bad reviews has already sealed the fate of Madame Web.This is not a bad movie. And make no mistake I'm a huge Marvel fan. Its just I'm able to watch a movie for what it is. I saw the ratings of 1 star everywhere and gave it a chance. It's a solid 6, less if you have strong feelings about the timeline. Its an origin story, with dodgy connections. But it's not a bad movie. It's almost not even a proper superhero movie as the lead 3 girls don't even develop their powers yet. But jees, it's not a 1 star movie. Lead villain... great casting but questionable dialogue and direction. Lead Woman... Wish she had studied more haha. Lead 3, beautiful, talented, great actresses, trying to get a foothold on a superhero franchise ina crowded market. They did great, they were meant to be virgin superheroes in this film. But I guess we will never get to see them bloom because of this stupid backlash.This movie world these days is so fickle. We didn't even get chance to let the public/viewer scores settle before the Usurper/critics led the charge and decreed a new religion. This is rubbish. Since when does the bank of critics have this power? Its rubbish and embarassing.Watch this film as it is, and have no expectations, and i bet you will find it a 6 or 7 and never a 1.This all doesn't mean anything anymore unless people give it a chance. It's not perfect, but it has a good story.(Oh and yeah she travels to and from Peru in too little time, i get it. Suspension of disbelief, come on. Who the hell knows how far Dagobah was for Luke anyhow? It's like ineed to take a tape measure to the cinema, why would i do that? Crazy critics)"
thespyfactory,1,It proves who you know not what you know in Hollywood,"You have seen all of the bad reviews right, wish I did before I went and wasted time and money on this pile of stink.I can only picture Sony folks all sitting listening to one person saying we should and everyone just nodding and saying great idea. This is the only way I can see how this got made. By far the worst superhero and current candidate for worst movie of the millennium. Sony should stop hiring Hollywood folks and try people with ZERO experience. I bet they would have done a better job. Really, it is that bad!For what you pay there is maybe five minutes of actual music and acting which makes you think, maybe all of this is not horrible. The rest of the time I found the family (superhero fanatics) playing on the phone instead of watching the movie, enough said.Product placements everywhere distracting from what little story there is. Horrible acting, script, characters and the scenes cutting all over the place just makes this another Sony disaster. Sony, please stop. Get rid of your team or hand it off to people who can make a movie."
kuteguy,2,Didn't know this movie exists. Wish it had not existed,"While flicking through movies to watch, my friend said 'Oh I wanted to watch the movie. It is a Marvel movie!'. I was surprised at first because it was not one I had heard of (I love superhero movies!) and had to watch the trailer to confirm that it was indeed a Marvel movie.Marvel what were you thinking? This movie is TERRIBLE. Don't they get it .. superhero fans are not interested in watching such movies that don't have ANY resemblance of a superhero movie arc.Captain Marvel flopped. The Marvels flopped even more. And this Madame Web seems like a TOTAL flop.The movie is BORING as hell. There is no story, no action, nothing interesting about anyone's backstory, nor a feeling that these characters are 'hero'. I hope this is the last we see of Madame Web (and The Marvels). Let's get back to traditional superhero movies and that is what fans want .."
Ltufano23,1,Madame Web Weaves a Messy and Dishonest Tale,"In the late 1990s, Marvel Comics was going through a rough patch. Declaring bankruptcy and floundering to survive the decade, they resorted to selling off the film rights of their beloved superheroes. While nearly all of those rights have now reverted to Marvel Comics under its parent company Disney, the final remaining lost asset is Spider-Man, purchased by Sony. Though the two companies have reached an agreement to allow the Web-Slinger to appear in the incredibly successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, Sony retains the film rights to Spidey's supporting cast. Although less popular than the Wall Crawler, Sony repetitively attempts to force them onto the big screen. Understanding that bit of history, audiences can now watch Madame Web.As an EMT in New York, Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) and Ben Parker (Adam Scott) routinely address emergencies throughout the city. After a car accident puts her in a near-death experience, Webb finds herself left with a mysterious gift of clairvoyance. Suffering from similar futuristic visions, Ezekial Sims (Tahir Rahim) embarks on a journey to hunt down 3 teenage girls. Acting as their protector, Cassandra Webb finds that great responsibility comes with her newfound great power.Spinning a disastrous tale, Madame Web suffers from doing too much and also, not enough. There is a very interesting and attractive film deep down under the mess, but focusing on its most boring elements, the film loses any semblance of redemption. While its best moments get mere seconds of screen time, the superhero/thriller spends most of its time teasing future adventures or referencing the larger Spider-Man mythos. Though it attempts to weave a decent origin story, it constantly dangles a more fascinating adventure that is never explored.Featuring recognizable names, performances ranged from decent to downright abysmal. Most of the line deliveries felt as if they were being read for the first time, lacking any sense of urgency or emotion. With a messy script and unexpressive dialogue to blame, there was not much the cast could do to improve upon it. Worst of all, the majority of Rahim's lines fail to fit the scenes that they're in, sounding as though they had been added in to replace the original dialogue. Though the cast is made up of enjoyable and promising actors, Madame Web will most likely be the lowest point in their careers.Viewer beware, looks can be very deceiving in Sony's newest attempt at a cash grab. While there are very few redeeming moments throughout the film, one of the biggest issues comes before viewers even get to the theaters. The trailers and marketing for the film tease an entirely different story than delivered. Focusing on aspects that are fleeting moments at best, the entire marketing of the film is built on selling a story that doesn't exist. Continuing Sony's trend of declining quality superhero films, Madame Web promises way more than it delivers.Madame Web is reminiscent of a long passed era of comic book films. Relying on its brand and putting minimal effort into the actual film, it fails to create what could have been an enjoyable movie. Prioritizing tongue-in-cheek references over a quality story, Madame Web tangles itself into a forgettable web of lies."
raja_sarkar,1,"An lifeless, lousy and idiotic movie","For me the decisive moment came early in the movie when a bunch of tribal ""spider"" people of Peru starts crawling down trees to rescue Constance. The animation (or lack of it), the superbad rubbery costume of the tribes (looked much like coming from some 80s low-budget TV movie), and that well-groomed Spanish looking tribal chief - all of them are total spoilsports.Secondly, Dakota should do something about her lifeless casual acting or actually the lack of energy which is evident across every single frame. Despite being such a famed actress, she maintained the same facial expressions and monotonous voice throughout the various events in the movie. It might have served other movies but this one is a Marvel movie and she is somehow the titular character!Thirdly, Tahar Rahim is not at all a good match for the Sims character that he had played. If you have ever gone through the Amazing Spider-Man books, you must have noticed the character looked completely different. It had a super-wrinkled face, crooked mien, grey hair etc. But Tahar looked fresh out of Salon every time he was presented. Plus, he looked so weird in the black spider suit, which seemed to me like a suit made by cutting truck tyres.I (and I am sure you too) can go on like this but, in actual, there are so many annoying, meaningless scenes which keeps pointing to only one direction - this is a stupid, lackluster movie, not even worth my neighbor's dog's time."
henryhenryhenry,1,like Spider-Man 1,"Sony set it up to be a failure because a woman leads the role . There's more anti-religious expletives like in Spider-Man 1 . That ruins any movie. I hated Spider-Man 1 but loved Spider-Man 2 . Keep the anti-religious expletives to yourself Hollywood. It's hard to keep fulfilling a 600 word limit when you targeted a movie to fail because women lead the role . Targeted with your script writing you target it just because you're sexist along with discriminatory in all other ways that are what you expect . Next time just change the language. That's not hard . Sydney Sweeney admitted it was a business decision which means she didn't like what you did with it . You tried to tank her career but obviously you did not .and remember no matter how much people might pan this review , it's automatic that an extremely large part of your audience is religious , no matter what movie you release. So keep out the anti religious expletives or your movie will fail at the box office and on streaming . Also we are tired of the tropes . Of course Sony would have to have O'Neill die , because they're threatened by him and others like him still to this day ."
carlcasso,7,Not sure why all the hate !,"I've no idea why people are giving this movie such a hard time .I've seen a lot worse getting higher scores.Ok it's never going to win awards and wasn't made to win awards .It was made to entertain and this is exactly what it does .The story is good, the acting is good and the action is great.Dakota Johnson plays the lead just right .She's likeable and believable.Tahar Rahim is the baddie and is decent .Sydney Sweeney ,Isabella Merced and Celeste O'Connor all put in good performances .We even get a bit or Emma Roberts and Adam Scott among others .I suspect this one will do well on the streaming platforms .It was a good movie and doesn't deserve all the hate ."
mr-bedford,4,It makes you wonder.,"If anyone has every watched Band of Brothers, in the second episode there is a scene where they are heading towards Normandy and the two pilots of the plane once they get close enough start seeing the sky light up and then the explosions and incoming started. They stared at each other in complete silence with a look of dread on their face wondering how the night will play out.That was the exactly the same thing when I watched this my my girlfriend, after five minutes we just looked at each other in silence, dread and I poured a very stiff drink.We watch a lot of 'bad' films but on purpose cos that's our thing, 70s/80s/90s trash.We were ill prepared for this outing. Everything was just an utter mess, from the writing, to the dialogue to the delivery of those woeful lines. There were so many clear times when they messed their lines and the timing, seeing camera reflections in glasses. That's the sort of thing I expect in the soaps (I'm from the UK, soap operas to my American friends)The camera work was all over the place, had some nice cinematography at times and some of the sound design was not bad. But that mixed in with a bunch of people with the personality of a book of stamps.This is a morbid curiosity film. Watch it if you have a spare couple of hours and a stiff drink.2/10 nothing redeeming about this."
hridayajaiswal,8,"i dont know why this got review bombed, I liked it","Well, this movie had a lot to cover, setup a base for the new heroes, it literally happens in the past of spiderman saga, and they connected the dots really well. Seeing uncle ben, Marry etc was a surprise I wasn't expecting. This part of the spiderman saga was really missing from the movies world so i'm really glad this movie came out. I can see that writers struggled a bit to pace the movie, and this movie is fast paced, but there was nothing missing, no confusion about the story, and overall, it was really well written given the amount of story and context this movie had to provide, and it must have been really challenging. At least they didn't make the movie three hours. Love to sony and marvel."
cdouglas-08062,7,why all the hate?,"So, I had read a lot of these reviews and it did make me not want to see this movie. However, I was talked into going and going in with almost no expectation at all. Everyone said the CGI was bad, or the script or how boring it was. I didn't find any of that to be true. It is just a normal origin story. I didn't think this movie was near as bad as people claim. The only thing I could think of is all these people hating on women leads in these superhero movies. Well, the main heroine is a woman obviously and the main supporting cast are women as well. The movie wasn't badly written, the acting wasn't bad and the CGI was just fine. The story flowed just fine and was entertaining."
scarletframe,4,Student film with professinals and big budget,"What a weird movie. Its definitely bad but it was the most enjoyable bad movie I have seen. It starts with so many off moments, off cuts, off takes. But is has a nice look to it and a nice vibe to the environment, I am actually admiring some of the look. It felt like a good 90's movie. Then it gets better but the action is just is filled with clichés and off takes. The acting is mediocre but it is hard to separate the poor writing from it. Some of the dialogue is just horrendous but then I forget it is bad and the story and powers keep it going forward. Some of the talking is clearly recorded in a studio after filming. What a weird movie."
reddiemurf81,4,Are you all immediate family?,"Cassandra Webb, known as Cassie, works as an NYC EMT, with her coworker Ben. She grew up in the foster care system due to her mother dying in childbirth. Cassie's mother was doing research on spiders in the jungle at the time of Cassie's birth. This research could've led to hundreds of cures for diseases.Cassie is somewhat awkward, and doesn't really respond to others in a normal, friendly way. While she cares for those she works with, she is closed off emotionally. All of this changes when Cassie has a near-death experience after drowning (well, she drowned after falling off a bridge during her shift as an EMT). She begins to have clairvoyant visions of the future. All of which involve three teenage girls named Julia, Anya, and Mattie. Along with a man named Ezekiel, who knew Cassie's mother.So,, this film is not good. It's not bad either, but it's definitely not good. I saw one review that said this movie made Morbius look like the Dark Knight. Lol, well I wouldn't say that exactly, but it's certainly not too far off. Imo, Morbius was REALLY GOOD by comparison (I actually liked Morbius, just didn't think it was near as good as it should've been).This movie suffered from bad writing, bad direction, no investment in characters or development of them either, and a lot of bad acting. Don't get me wrong, their are some ""ok"" moments. I just don't get how Johnson is still working. Yeah, she's not hard on the eyes, and not a terrible actress, but that in no way equals good either. Sweeney did a good job of making herself seem like a teenager (I continue to like her more the more I see her in things). The other two actresses were perfectly fine, and of course Roberts & Scott were great. The Ezekiel actor was aslo fine, but not a great bad guy either.Overall, there just wasn't enough here to make this movie good. I'd give it a 4.9 rating if that were an option."
Karamakate,4,A clickbait that disrespects Madame Web's true lore,"From the trailers I can't be the only one that got the impression that the 3 supportive characters would get their powers and suits which would be a cool Spidey-related film. Turns out it was just visions in two short sequences which makes the biggest clickbait I've ever seen in a movie.How can you not want to include something like that in an origin movie?!The characters: extremely shallow and even in the long run pointless. I don't understand the ageism call to have a young cast instead of an older woman. I'm a big fan of Madame Web from the animated Spidey series from the 90s and late 90s Spidey comics where she featured great story arcs. Imagine someone iconic like Isabelle Huppert portraying Web and Mel Gibson portraying Ezekiel, that would've been lit.Acting: Really bad. Loved Dakota in Suspiria but she looked so bored thru out MW so I don't even get why she took the role.Sydney gets absolutely nothing to work with but worst are Celeste O'Connor and Tahar Rahim. Tahar was pretty good in The Mauretanian so it's wild to see him this underused. I haven't seen Celeste before but she clearly thought this was a comedy. When Ezekiel kills cops at the train station Celeste rolls her eyes and does weird grimacing. Such a weird scene.Isabela Merced, Zosia Mamet, Adam Scott and too some extent Emma Roberts are the only ones trying to deliver. What's even more wild is that Jill Hennessy who is early 00s television royalty is downgraded to a nameless character, as if the film crew had no idea of her previous works.The plot: Plain out ridiculous. Every joke and easter egg feels so forced and pointless, the idea of giving MW her own rendition of an Uncle Ben speech is just weird and the idea of having Peter Parker being born is even more weird.Ezekiel is the lamest villain in any Marvel production and his motive to chase the girls is the most ridiculous thing I've seen. You don't get to know the guy or even why he wears a suit to begin with. Nothing like comic Ezekiel.The final scene with MW:s final outfit is so badly designed and huge letdown.The cinematography: The camera angles, editing, lighting and special effects were all over the place. Why did Sony hire a directorial debut for this film?Overall biggest letdown I've seen in 7 years."
wildecoyote,3,Well,I went and saw Madam Web at the cinema and it was mediocre to say the most. I am a big fan of Marvel characters but Sony can't seem to make a good marvel character movie. I think Madam Web had the potential to be an awesome movie but alas not to be.Like others have said why does Sony hire writers who don't do a good job. They should look at their own movies and the ones they make with Marvel. Spiderman earn over 2 billion from memory and Madam Web about 95 million.I have seen every Marvel character movie at the cinema since Infinity War including the Sony ones. I don't think I will continue to go to the sony ones.and just buy the on DVD like I have all the Marvel characters.
kierasayshello,3,I thought it would be more of a superhero movie.,"I'm just disappointed because it did interest me a little, the idea of these team of girl superheroes. Instead, we're told they're superheroes in the future, see maybe 2 minute sof their costumes and that's it. Super disappointing.Besides that, it was cringy. Pretty sure the villain had a lot of voice over lines and his lines were also very typical villain. Same goes for Cassie, very typical hero lines. It was all very awkward. Characters were bland too.The movie was very confusing the way it was shot. Some scenes went by way too fast, I could barely comprehend what was happening. I liked the vision scenes only because I felt like we also saw what Cassie saw and understood her confusion.Only part I especially liked was the connection to Peter Parker."
moov_e_c_er,7,In the grand scheme of things,"Overall, this movie was super slammed by bad reviews. This movie itself is not bad, but it has a few bad techniques that are hard to pull off.For example, the fact of any future telling moments or traveling back in time is always going to be jarring to the viewer and reminding them that they are watching a movie instead of being left to follow and enjoy the scenes progress.As for this being a female ensemble movie instead of a solo female lead was a surprise if you didn't see/read any ads/interviews beforehand. If one was to be blasted with the ads interviews, etc., then they would not be surprised at anything. If this was a solo story maybe it would have been a lot more development in character, story, timing and believability.With each female led movie, the normal way to get good and full press (success) is basically the female lead is usually one that has a lot of projects and a lot of successes: it is hard to name much if any of a well done female lead movie or franchise (this can be due to the business not putting in the money, weak scripts/stories, saying no one likes female led movies, lack of press, cheesy ads not showcasing the talent or main story, or the audience not being open to it or by limited releases).I do not say that these women have not had successes or even lack in projects, but it feels like newer talent was being banked on instead of even more recognizable women. I say this as I only knew the lead and had to look up the others to find if and where I knew them from. This means no one stood out, no one gave a banging performance, and I blame the script of random people and the belief to follow a stranger again and again until things really start to happen. It could have been more believable, more worked out and more giving each actress some great moments to showcase their talent.Overall this is watchable, enjoyable at times, does have a story and pushes it forward but it was done several times in a junky cheap feeling way. But at the same time several movies are being done and released this way claiming no one goes to the theatre anymore: make good and great scripts, cast good to great cast members, everyone work their part to their best, and stop releasing half-baked and half thought out stories that no one cares about! Stop making auto scripts and stop just redoing other movies (that is what no one wants to see)!"
Hassan-Helmy-891-218066,4,Sad output for a highly anticipated movie,"When I started watching this movie, it provided a nice background into what could have a great superhero movie. The rest of the first was also decent, with a nice character buildup as well as setting the scene properly for our hero characters.The way went south all of a sudden, with us losing track of why characters acted the way they did with each other.It just does not make sense that 3 new strangers start loving and respecting each other after a few hours of getting acquainted, especially when there was a very high distrust at the start of their encounter.The CGI then started giving way, and even the production efforts were nowhere to be felt.It is a sad way to quickly extinguish a good start for a movie."
dpivato,8,So bad it's good,"K... so I read all the negative reviews and honestly, it made me want to watch it more to see how bad it was. Mostly because some movies are so bad they are actually hilariously entertaining, like the Marine.It is not as bad as people have made out, I've watched WAY worse, however, the story has its moments where you are certain it was written by an 8th grader.That said it definitely has some great ""so bad it's good moments. The beginning and ending in particular are hilarious.That said I would love to see a sequel that embraces this aspect of the movie where completely ridiculous situations occur with completely ridiculous frequency, and have completely unexplained consequences that do not follow logical reasoning."
jamesmeeks62,6,NOT BAD,"Okay.....let's start with the the probable fact that MOST of the low reviews who are the impatient and entitled skeptics who THINK they know movies....and who were probably playing candy crush or whatever ""hip"" thing there is nowadays.....probably social media on ways to to get softer hair with mayonnaise and pickle juice.....anyway....the point is that purpose of this movie is what's known as an ""origin story""....that's sarcasm for you ""Critics....skeptics...whatever"". Origin stories...for the most part....are and should be a bit slow....this way you get to know each character. It's whatever....to those people all I can say is ""write, direct, produce your own movie....you obviously have the natural ability to scope out what's trash and what should be Oscar Nominated (more sarcasm....just in case that wasn't picked up). Okay.....no spoilers....but this movie is definitely a setup for something else....origin story like I said before. Yes it's a bit all over the place but that's what makes for a good origin story.....you pretend that you're a part of that movie. How would you feel if you're one of the main characters? You're going to feel confused and overwhelmed because you have all this madness coming at you all at once. Watch it....don't watch it but I guarantee you that anything rated between 1 and 5....ignore them.....but that's what I look for when I watch an initial super hero/villain type movie....chaos and confusion because when you go to a movie...you go to get away and movies like these....you imagine what it would feel like if you were in that type of situation. Enjoy the movie....ignore the low ratings from the primitives."
bendersl,1,Save Yourself the Misery - Have a V8!,"This movie was soooooooo bloody bad. What a waste of film! My husband wanted to watch it since it was a Marvel movie. After the first 10 minutes, I went and played games on my iPad it was so boring. The acting sucks. The lines were so lame. And the costumes? Are we in the 1980's? What were they thinking here???? Just save yourself the brain cells and go drink a V8 instead. Your body will thank you and you'll save the run-time to do something you might actually enjoy vs. Wasting it watching this rubbish. I think someone needs to go back to the drawing board and actually write something people want to watch."
marineproductions1,4,very bad writing,"I walked into this flick not knowing what the buzz was or what folks thought of it. Gave it a shot for about an hour, on and off, but damn, it was a struggle to keep up. Characters were all over the place, acting out in ways that just didn't make sense.Found a few bits that caught my eye, though. Lead actress getting those future vibes? That was kinda cool.But then it took a nosedive. Characters pulling off stunts that had me rolling my eyes, and the places they ended up? Felt like they were being dragged there.Felt bad for the actors, man. Doing their best with what they had, but the script was just flat. Dialogue? Meh. Did the job, but nothing to write home about.Got this itch to bail, but with all the flashy effects, I stuck around. Big-budget feel, you know? But damn, it didn't save the sinking ship.Checked the IMDb rating - a measly 3.8 out of 10. Tells you all you need to know, really.So, I hit fast-forward, hoping for some redeeming moments. Got to the end, and all I could think was, ""Two hours wasted.""Straight up? Save yourself the trouble, skip this one. Plenty of other flicks out there worth your time."
PeterParker63,2,SONY just needs to stop immediately-this ain't working,"Sony's done it again-utilized the vast breadth of their Marvel Comics characters catalog of licensed characters, and have found yet another way to use a little known (except to comics fans) Spider-Man side character to put into a major motion picture vehicle with hopes to create an MCU-like series of films that will either have sequels or interconnect into a wider universe of storyline-linked films with other Sony licensed Marvel properties and again-it just wasn't terribly good, and for a variety of reasons.Dakota Johnson seems to be ""phoning-it-in"" in some scenes, while striving to turn in a decent performance in others that were slightly better written. The girls playing the potential future female spider-powered people she bumps into and strives to protect, serve mostly to give Dakota Johnson something to do as she tries to protect them, figure out who the antagonist is who is trying to come after her and the girls, while trying to uncover the mystery of her mother's death and research, while trying to figure out her own emerging ""spider-powers."" Her character is written as out of touch and aloof and she ultimately comes across unlikable. That takes me to the antagonist in this picture, Ezekiel Sims.He has incredibly embarrassingly poorly written motivations and even worse dialogue that appears to have either been heavily dubbed over, ADRed, poorly delivered on camera by the actor, or some weird combination of all three. It was so poorly acted by this man that it was distracting. I looked around at the 6 other people in the theater (matinee showing on Saturday 2/17 @ 3:40PM in a major southern city) to see if they were seeing and responding to his awful screen presence and performance. I'm sure this man in real life is a talented actor, but this role either wasn't for him or something, because not only was his performance poor, but again-his motivations lacked any creativity. He essentially had worked with and subsequently had stolen some rare spider Dakota Johnson's (Madame Web) mom found during research in the Amazon 30 years before. We don't know what he did with the spider or the associated research, or really why he murders Madame Web's mom other than the vague reason he gives about not being helped when he was growing up poor, but since Madame Web's mom was pregnant with her at the time, she was rescued by jungle dwelling mystical spider-people who deliver Dakota's character and through their mystical spider-based powers, imbued her with special precognitive gifts right before the mom dies. The villain then starts having dreams where Spider-powered females hunt him and down and hill him, so he uses the NSA and hacking street cams in NYC to find said potential future Spider-girls so he can kill them to save himself. Yes-if it sounds absurd even for a comic book movie, you're right and it goes no further than that for the villain's motivations. After an accident Cassandra (Madame Wen)The film overall strays so far from the source material that Sony has created an entirely original character with the same name and powers of the original comic book character. It's basically the 2024 version of 2004's ""Catwoman"" movie (slight similarity in appearance and name alone, but everything else, from setting, origin story, and supporting characters all being mostly original creations for the film.) At no point do the man's visions even come true as neither of the teen girls obtain powers or even pose a threat to him. It's bizarrely written and organized.The film appears to have been heavily re-shot, or re-edited to disinclude what was probably an entirely different plot and motivation for really, everybody in the film. The useless wink and nod to the audience about Spider-Man's Uncle Ben watching over his sister in law Mary before she gives birth to an unnamed child go no where, and the action is mostly reduced to Dakota Johnson leaving the girls to fend for themselves before setting off fireworks in a Pepsi-Cola building where the letters fall on the villain, I guess killing him, in which she essentially tricks him (Ezekiel, who does have Spider-Man's powers except for spinning webs and a spider sense) with her ability to both see the immediate future, allowing Madame Web to see his next move and then later on, split into 3 other entities or something. It's bizarre and poorly depicted and written. Other than the final action set piece, it's mostly her driving the kids around and hiding them until she figures out her next move going place to place in a stolen taxi cab she uses, along with an ambulance to run over Ezekiel to incapacitate him long enough to escape again. It's that ridiculous.Overall, there must be some reason Sony's unable to include Spider-Man in these god-awful films (this one, Venom, Morbius, the soon to be released Craven) and it hurts these films. These characters rarely if ever are featured in their own comic book titles and are SOLELY written to be side characters in Spider-Man comic titles as supporting characters for him to interact with or for them to interact with HIS stories. That's why I'm saying if there's some weird restriction with using Spidey because of MCU inclusion in their universe, then make Spider-Man 2099 or Miles Morales or Spider-Woman pictures instead. Otherwise? If Sony continues down this path, they're going to drag Disney down by association as most people can't tell the difference between these two studios' Marvel character-based film series. They just need to sell back the rights so they can revert back to Marvel and stop these pointless side films nobody is going to see. They didn't get the message with Morbius, but hopefully they'll start to get the bigger picture with this film's failure and the likely future failure of Kraven-a movie about a Spider-Man villain that is only interesting because he's a Spider-Man villain."
I_Ailurophile,3,Too much poor writing and too many poor creative decisions sap away its potential,"Ever the age-old question when a new release quickly flounders and earns a poor reputation: how bad could it be? After a certain point it's not enough to read about such works, and we have to see them for ourselves. While this was the first full-length feature for director S. J. Clarkson, she has enjoyed a full career in television. Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless' screenplay for 2016's 'Gods of Egypt' notably had its issues, though it wasn't the biggest problem in that film, and anyway I remember enjoying their work on 'The last witch hunter.' Whatever one thinks of other movies they've been in, there are some fairly respected actors here. And on the one hand, while Sony's live-action superhero fare has been met with mixed reception, it's not like they're totally incompetent - after all, they've churned out two of the best superhero flicks ever made in 'Into the Spider-Verse' and 'Across the Spider-Verse.' All this is to say that at least based on its building blocks, 'Madame Web' probably had chances that were just about even. Unfortunately, once we sit to watch, in no time the viewing experience becomes rather laborious, and with a runtime of nearly two hours, one thing we have to be thankful for is that this isn't longer like too many of its kin.I suppose it's possible that if someone is an especial fan of comic book movies then this might meet with more favor in their eyes. By the same token, I pretty well tired of action blockbusters a few years ago, and just completely gave up on the ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"" in 2018, so maybe I'm more prone to harsh judgment of a like-minded title. In absolute fairness, I see the potential that this had. While it's flush with superhero flavors, the core narrative is a thriller about precognitive visions and the protection of three young people who will important in the future; other pieces have played in this space to swell success. Some intended humor actually does earn a laugh. Clarkson's direction is technically competent, I find no fault with the actors in and of themselves, and this is well made from the standpoint of all those contributions from behind the scenes: stunts, effects, computer-generated imagery, costume design, hair, makeup, cinematography, editing, sound, Johan SÃ¶derqvist's original score, and so on and so on. All this is well and good, so what is it that troubles 'Madame Web?' However skilled the participants may be in and of themselves, their efforts here were guided by questionable creative choices, and above all, this film is woefully heavy-handed, and in no time becomes all too exhausting.I am someone who loves watching pictures. I'll watch almost anything, and it's how I spend the majority of my free time. Too often this picture feels like a personal attack on me as a cinephile; I intermittently had to pause for several minutes to collect myself just because I felt overwhelmed by the presentation. From the opening scene onward, far more than not the writing is gawkily forthright and unsubtle, and oppressively emphatic - in its exposition, dialogue, scene writing, characterizations, the plot and its development, contemporary references and allusions to the early 2000s setting, nods to broader comic book lore, and too much of the humor (that is, those bits that don't land). I don't know where the culpability lies between Sazama, Sharpless, Clarkson, and co-writer Claire Parker, but the incidence is all too notable. That same gawky, forthright, unsubtle, oppressive, emphatic tack is subsequently applied to or infects a great deal of other facets throughout the runtime: the soundtrack, the acting, Clarkson's orchestration of scenes as director, Mauro Fiore's cinematography, Leigh Folsom Boyd's editing, the CGI, action sequences, the manner in which Cassie's visions are employed, the more fantastical costume designs, and more. Even in some quieter moments, like a ""confrontation"" early in the latter half between Cassie and Ezekiel, 'Madame Web' is a lot to take in and try to process, and not in a good way.It's not wholly rotten. More than not I think the root story is fine and interesting. There are some nice touches here and there, kernels of welcome earnestness, and some admirable themes and bigger ideas. While the entirety does force the actors into some small corners, in the best moments where their abilities shine through I think the cast go a long way in making the feature palatable. The more judicious and mindful instances of editing and CGI are excellent, even where Cassie's visions are concerned, and likewise the other odds and ends; the filming locations and sets are generally splendid. Reading about the production I find myself pleased with the consideration and hard work that accordingly went into it in various ways, and I appreciate the sentiment, indicated in early press releases from Sony, that the endeavor would be a slightly different type of superhero flick, more of a ""suspense-driven thriller."" Even with loads of action that tenor truly is brought to bear in my opinion, a refreshing change of pace from the overbearing popcorn flicks of Marvel and DC, and I'd even go so far as to say that 'Madame Web' is surely stronger in its second half; it seems apparent that there comes a point where more care was taken, and my favor is restored to some degree. I see what the title genuinely does well.I don't think this is absolutely awful. I think the harder it tries, and the more grandiose it tries to be, especially at the climax, the more it stumbles. The more it steps away from the ""suspense-driven thriller"" and toward ""superhero action blockbuster,"" the more it struggles; the more it layers on the sentimentality (not least in the denouement), the more it raises a skeptical eyebrow. There is, in fact, a decent amount of value here, yet through to the end it remains true that wide swaths of the viewing experience are sadly gawky, forthright, unsubtle, oppressive, and emphatic. Listen, I love The Cranberries, but the use of their song over the end credits literally made me cringe. 'Madame Web' is a rickety roller coaster from desperately heavy-handed for a preponderance of the first hour, to more reserved and thoughtful in a fair stretch of the second half, and regrettably, back to desperately heavy-handed in its last few scenes. Had all gone well with this production, and had it been uniformly approached in the same measured fashion, I think I would have very much liked this, and maybe even looked forward to future stories with these characters. As it stands, I want to like the result more than I do, but I'm having difficulty mustering further kind feelings. I'm glad for those who get more out of it than I do; for those who engage honestly with it, and step away disliking it even more, I understand. When all is said and done I can't bring myself to hate 'Madame Web' - I'm just sorry that everyone involved took a swing, made some miscalculations, and missed, with disastrous consequences. My best wishes for all who had a hand in this, and may they bounce back and/or redeem themselves in due course."
bothworks,3,Yes I hear you all - but what's good about the movie?,"Here's what's good out of the bad [acting, screenplay, dialogue, music, sound, loops (I feel we need an ""etcetera"" here but whatever)]The short story/plotline - was fun;Has a new ""look"" for a Super hero movie; andSydney Sweeney.With a LOT of negative energy in the Madame Web user review pages, I think it's time we move on and understand waht really matters here - that Pepsi Won, the financiers didn't lose much - Madame Web went through ""years"" of development and powered through their first cut in the screening room(s) - the producers closed their eyes and thought ""We're not throwing $80M out - let's just hope the trailer is good...""Aspiring writers and film makers should be happy knowing that - if this can be made in our world run by content - then so can yours; this is a teachable moment for writers, along every aspect of filmmaking - ""Madame Web"" will always serve as an emblematic case study."
federicoguillemi,1,"How did this make its way out of the ""No"" pile","Precuel of a movie or series that no on will bother to see. This movie is so bad, so obvious, that you suffer all through the 2 hours long they take to set the poor back story and the not developed characters.As you dive into the life of our heroine we are introduced to yet another awful villain which no one bothered to provide a background for or how he comes to be that way. Then the whole sorry becomes so thin, so ""preparing for"" that suddenly you find your self in the last fight scene, not caring for none of the characters and hoping they all just die as you hope in good movies did after you suffered 2 hours because of this such a bad movie."

I don't understand why all the hate."
michvanbeek,4,"One big mess of a movie, stop making Marvel movies this way please.","The Marvel universe has not excelled in releasing good films in recent years, especially after Disney took over the entire Marvel stable, it turned out to be quantity over quality. Yes, of course there were some outliers among them who were really good, but the large part after Avengers: Endgame seemed to be far undersized. The low point was reached in my opinion with The Eternals and The Marvels. The advantage that Madame Web has is that it was once again made by Sony Pictures, so that already offers a little bit of hope. That hope turned out to be unjustified, because immediately after the film was released, Madame Web was razed to the ground by critics, so much so that I really started to have my doubts a bit about whether that was justified. With a dramatically low audience score on both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb, Madame Web has been put to dead and I definitely want to judge that myself. It wasn't as bad as these sites wanted to come across and The Eternals and The Marvels still remain the worst out of Marvel's stable, but Madame Web knows how to hold a solid third place very simply as far as I'm concerned.With a budget of about $80 million in your pocket, names like Dakota Johnson and rising star Sydney Sweeney, you'll still expect to get something decent to see. But that lags far behind. The opening is not yet so terrible, but it lacks some form of logic in the film at every point. Constance, Cassandra Webb's mother, is looking for a special spider in the Jungle along with Ezekiel. With her pregnant belly she finds the spider that should be able to cure diseases, but Ezekiel has other plans with that, why? No idea. Eventually he steals the spider and leaves Contance for death, who is found again by a mysterious tribe that Constance is pricked by the spider and finally get baby Cassandra. You, after the incident she likes spontaneously, but okay. We see that more often in movies. Then the whole thing moves to Manhattan where Cassandra works on the ambulance. No form of explanation or anything is given and suddenly Cassandra has all the powers. It doesn't really hit side or shore, but good.Then the three ladies Julia, Anya and Mattie come up completely without explanation and out of nowhere and suddenly Ezekiel is after them for no reason in a kind of Spider-Man suit, something Madame Web is a spin off of. All you know is that Ezekiel has visions of the ladies wanting to kill him, the why still remains and mystery. What Ezekiel's big plan actually is, that also remains a mystery and I can really make sure that Ezekiel is really one of the most lousy bad guys I saw in a superhero movie, it doesn't make sense at all and even worse, it really doesn't go anywhere. You are thrown into the action from time to time, the story literally goes in all directions and in the end you can do nothing with it and most people will be left in amazement at what they have actually been looking at. There could have been so much more in this, but in my opinion Madame Web was really rightly burned down and if this is the yardstick that the future Marvel- films are going to come with, then I really give up completely.Madame Web may not be as bad as many want to make it happen, but the reactions are easy to understand. The story goes in all directions and sometimes really makes no sense at all. In terms of bad guys, with Ezekiel we really get to see the most lousy villain from all Marvel- movies combined. What his final goal was remains a very big mystery even after the film. With a budget of 80 million dollars and such a casting, you would expect to be able to make something much better than this bad product. He always remains even better than The Eternals and The Marvels, but a solid third place definitely takes this film."
rwbwvxqj,10,I loved it,"I'm liked this movie especially for being the original story. I don't know why they gave it such bad reviews and I love Dakota Johnson in this movie! I am a little mad that people hated on it so much and now we don't get to see her and all the girls in the marvel cinematic universe. I think people just like to hate women super heroes. I think if this movie came out 5 years ago when everyone was hyping up Wonder Woman this would have performed really well but since captain marvel there's just all this hate. I think they deserved a little more love, it was entertaining and reminded me of the old Spider-Man movies."
jerridhargrove,7,Are we seeing the same movie??!,"Madame Web was a solid superhero movie. To me it enhances established characters and add new possibilities to Spiderverse. Wasn't sure what to expect from the trailers, but was thoroughly surprised. I'm starting to agree that there seems to be some serious hate towards the female superhero movies. I hope people gives this movie a chance and not stay away because of the hate. I also hope Sony continues exploring down the spider hole. Just hope along the way we get a Venom-Spider-Man movie. No this movie won't win any Oscar's and probably won't even end up being the best superhero movie this year (sorry but Deadpool). However, this movie is worth your time if you just give it a chance."
Katy-moraitis,3,Bad in every way,"The story, the acting, the chemistry, the action, the script.. tragic. A whole lot of money for a whole lot of nothing. Do not waste your time and money. The only question I have is why? Did they not know this would be a flop? Why did everyone, including some famous actors, not see this was so bad when they read the script. Maybe they put out some really bad films to make average ones look better than they are. This whole super hero thing needs some kind of change. Every movie has become predictable and boring. You don't even pause when you go to the restroom because you know you won't miss anything important."
mcphailkingkoopaphil,2,Another terrible outing for sony,"They honestly need to give up on anything spider verse related every movie they have made is just a train wreak. Whoever sat down at the table and said hey check out this screenplay and approved it needs to be fired. Morbius was super bad this is probably worse. The next one we have to be disappointed in will be kraven they need to just burn that film before it ever gets released. I can't even believe this got a theatrical release, I hope anyone that actually paid for this got a refund. The good news is that this is such a poor movie we'll never actually get the chance to see a second part Sony needs to give up the reins."
preyn-30669,5,I've seen worse,"I actually watched Madame Web first before reading the reviews so that I could give it a fair assessment. I personally believe the storyline did have potential however there were some errors I picked up on while the story progressed. The nemesis in the movie wasn't impressive actually I found him quite boring. The performances of the three young ladies, Celeste O' Connor, Sydney Sweeney, and Isabela Merced wasn't too bad. As for Dakota Johnson, I never actually followed her career so I don't have an opinion. I'm not sure where Marvel is going with this film but I do agree if there's a sequel l, I don't know if I would see it. That's really unfortunate because I'm a fan of Marvel."
ryanhadi,3,"Bad script, worse direction","If you're going to write a script and make a movie out of it, please do better. The plot was flaky and the director didn't even bother!Begin with giving time for relationships between characters to develop before they start to throw cheesy lines.There's also that thing about actors having facial expressions that audiences can see and Dakota Johnson definitely doesn't have many of those.Would've loved to see how Cassie figures out her powers and learns to use them.Why is Ezekiel shown to be super powerful and great with his reflexes but suddenly loses track and gets distracted by the fireworks?Lots of why's there..."
TharangaDE,3,"If i was the director, I burn it down","I can't believe i watched the whole movie. Storyline was awful ðŸ˜” How the hell script like this getting greenlight in Sony. I can't believe it. Lately we are losing our faith in the Sony production movies.I really feel bad for the actors in the film. They are not ment for this kind of garbage. I think even they knows it. I watched some great roles portrait by these actors on some films before. But in here: really bad ðŸ˜¢I don't think director and producer watch the movie after the production is done. Because if i was the director of the film, and i watched it after the production, i will burn the whole thing before it burn my career. There are no shame in it."
iceteaisgood-44421,1,Very terrible movie for Marvel,"The actor for ben parker and cassie I think did good but the 3 girls and the evil fake wannabe spiderman were terrible the whole movie. When Cassie was in the water you could tell her face was CGI.Really disappointed with the script and honestly im glad that I did not go to the movies to watch it. All the ending costumes were cringe as cringe could be.I usually watch superhero marvel/dc/prime stuff more then once but for this movie it is a 1 and done, I actually took my time watching it between 2 days because I was not at all into the story line, It's really a joke to the sport of movie making."
wcfpgtzkj,6,Not that bad,I think it's just a bunch of men that can't stand women as the entire main cast! Was it a great movie not really but does it deserve a 3.5 absolutely not. I gave it a solid 6. It kept you in the movie even during the slower spots. There are a few surprises and if you didn't figure it out during the movie you do get to see Peter Parker and uncle Ben but they are definitely a little side surprise to to the movie and not main characters. It is kind of disjointed and rushed on some things like the instantaneous companionship between the three girls. The ending was a bit strange as well but I can't really say anything about that without giving it away.
panpant-93824,1,So sad,"I didn't go into this with high expectations and boy was I right.Knowing the characters from Marvel comics, I expected somehow more in terms of character development but it was awful.The acting from every single cast member was abysmal, wooden by the lead and simply lost by everyone else.Badly written, poorly acted by all involved, time stretches that don't seem to fit with current continuity and the costumes! Wow, for the 30 seconds or so that you saw them, so poor, looking like childrens costumes...
I fell asleep after 20 minutes and woke up at the credits, I think that the inside of my eyelids were preferable to this complete rubbish."
basagra,10,Loved it!! Dont believe the hate!,"Amazing and unique story, Fun lore and easter eggs on spiderman and the others, Amazing concept and acting from the whole cast!!! The bad guy was the only thing i didnt like but even then it was passable. . Everything else was fun!! I had missed details the first time so i have seen it multiple times to catch all the details! It was a great time and my family have watched it multiple times!! Dont believe the hate or Bias. Plenty of people hate supers, hate women being supers, and women in general. Ignore them and enjoy the movie!! I have seen plenty complaining about the lead actress as well and i really enjoyed her through out the movie so im assuming its just more bias."
adeelson,6,Not great but best Super Hero film for a while,"To get such a low rating they obviously did not employ enough bots. The film was not great but it was entertaining and the was a very good sense of jeopardy something that has been lacking in most super hero films. All in all a good first movie I would like to see more.Oh and 600 words for a review is way too much, if it is not to contain spoilers. My main gripe about the film is it is not set in the MCU world which takes some time to figure out. Really cant say any more with out spoilers still got a hundred words to type. I guess this would not be a problem for a bot which is why the rating is probably so poor!"
ScorpioDog,2,Just Bad...,"I went into this expecting an insanely poor film, but it was just a regular sort of bad.There were some elements that I actually did enjoy, such as the main powers the 'Madame Web' character had. However, they could have used these powers in a more creative way or implement a unique visual style when these powers appear on screen. It is a shame, because Sony manages to do this with the 'Spider-Verse' films but not with the live-action ones. Some of the superhero costumes were quite good, but barely feature in the film.The main villain's motivation was quite silly and did not make a lot of sense if you dissect the plot a bit. I don't know if there was an issue with the main villain's accent or possibly with dubbing, but there was something off about it. Every time he speaks in the film you can tell there is an issue with his audio. The dialogue was definitely one of the worst aspects as a whole.I would not recommend this personally, but you may enjoy it in a 'so bad it is good' way."
Chazzwins,3,It was watchable,"By far not the worst movie you can watch. Just a little flat and underwhelming, but good action and has some good moments. If you can't find anything else to watch it's not so bad. I made a few possible connections to the Spider-Man, but it did not go to deep and you have to connect the dots. Over all unlike a lot of films that make me regret watching this one did not make me feel that wat. This film also is set up for a part two if the want to. I think with better writing that isn't rushed and maybe connect it with some other New Your Marel characters like Luke Cage or Jessica Joan's it could be very interesting."
purebloodfanpire,5,Excellent score,"I read a review that said the movie is horrible, but the score is fantastic. So far I agree w/the 2nd part. The score (not music) is fantastic.I don't know if it's the writing or the role or acting or all the above, but Alison Sweeney is not a good actress in this. The other two teens are horrible, but she's the worst of the three. I don't get the innocent my dad's new family hates me.Like people said for Morbius it could've been great. Also, I'm confused. In this universe Ben & Mary are siblings not husband & wife like every other.Funny how the Cassie dislikes it seems kids yet in the end she becomes there guardian.The ending is very anticlimactic. I know its an orgin story, but come on."
mrgaetano,3,The girls were great,"The acting from all of the leading ladies was great. The writing definitely could have been better. But the casting of Tahar Rahim ruined this movie, who actually paid this man to be in this movie it was truly the biggest mistake every time he spoke it got worse. Any actor would have improved his role and I stand by that. Definitely not sequel worthy but I think Dakota did great with what she had to work with. Let's get some better writers and some better male actors Sony let's step it up we would all appreciate it. Also why doe reviews have to be so long I'm out of complaints just let me post it."
tukfai,3,Bored as expected and Marvel is a red herring,"There is no real Marvel action, it looks like a normal budget movie using the marvel of iron man and spiderman to makes the sales.This movie has no action or super heroes, if you want to see action, it is the next sequel but this is so awful, who would want to see it.Even I had free tickets to cinema, I did not want to use it as it looks rubbish, reviews were awful. It is Ms Marvel or the other recent action movies.The story is sooooo boring, based in a remote island to keep cost down and spiderman is so crap, he wants to take his mask as he wants his face to be shown all the times and he is awful compared to spiderman, where is his super power? He keeps getting beaten up by a non super woman using basic tools.Even he tries to kill the teenagers who has no super power, what is stopping future giving super power to different girls. It is so silly story.Is fine, I watched it when I was bored and didn't lose much."
CrankyGoose,4,It's definitely not worth watching,"I had high hopes for this movie. I waited it and I thought that It will be very nice and stunning movie to be honest. From the first seconds of this I was already so confused about what happens in the movie. It looked like if two different scenes tied into one. Also, the actions in the movie was quite unexpected. It was impossible to understand what would happen next.. the events that happened and will happen are very incomprehensible and different. But the special effects are a separate issue.. they look like they were from 2005 or smth? They are not really bad.. the acting wasn't great either. The movie was very long, they could make it much shorter and you wouldn't lose anything from the plot. The scenes are very long, for example, when Cassie was driving, this scene alone took all of 5 minutes. We learned almost nothing except the names of the main characters. Another scene in the forest also takes up a lot of screen time. The events in the movie dont coincide with what will happen. I think that even fans could make such a movie. I think if Cassie had stayed that paramedic, the movie would have been even more interesting than when she became a spider-woman. I dont recommend watching."
karlevans-75682,7,Madame dread,"So what to say about madame Webb I hated it I liked it I soo wanted it to be better but please I implore you don't make a sequel.Headliner Dakota Johnson turns in a confusing performance as a impossibly good looking new york city paramedic who after a near miss can see the future but only in a couple of minute spurts, mom was a spider hunter and got bit when pregnant with Dakotas character cassie Webb. Hence this slightly ambiguous err superpower.The villain of the piece is suitably villainous but comes across like a dark spider man after harnessing a special spiders powers for wrong doing.Culminating in a final battle high above the rooftops of a building loaded with dodgy Chinese fireworks I kid you not lol.All in all it's not a bad movie or idea it's just there's something fundamentally missing, unfortunately my spider sense wasn't tingling from this one Devoid of any marvel references to other err Spidermen. It's Saturday afternoon sofa fodder at best, but hey God loves a trier!!"
johnspringer-95440,2,My Mom Was In The Amazon Watching Madame Web Right Before She Died Of Boredom,"Yes, it's really that bad. I can't fault the cast because they had nothing with which to work. Otherwise every aspect of this movie is beneath contempt. The script, first and foremost, is atrocious. The plot is goofy and the dialogue is inane expositional tripe. The direction is awful too. There's a self-serious earnestness to everything that makes the dreadful dialogue even more grating. The action scenes look cheap and the action is tepid. It's also obvious they overdubbed the villian's dialogue and didn't even bother to try to match it with the actor's mouth. I guess by that point in production some sound editor figured the movie couldn't be any worse anyway and stopped trying. 2 stars because if this movie is very lucky it'll be a future so-bad-it's-good classic like Plan 9 From Outer Space or The Room."
fozia-52252,9,Unfairly critiqued,"Must watch for spiderman fanatics! There were a few of those key moments bedded in there that make you feel connected to Peter Parker. A few familiar faces in there too which is always nice across the multiverse.I thought the story was well written and interesting. There wasn't a moment I wanted to sleep as there was with marvel elementals.Really confused at the awful reviews, you will miss out if you don't watch it because of the reviews.The acting was great, especially from actresses that haven't been in roles like it before it was great to see action sides from them. The only thing that took away from it for me was the production value of the camera shots and CGI. Loved the links to spider-man."
urulhai,6,A lot of lobby,"We watched MW on NetF. The media destroyed this movie. Vilified it. And, in my opinion, all that was (mostly) the power of the Disney lobby. In my opinion, the story was well told, Dakota was quite engaging as a lead, and I really enjoyed the movie.All the way from the top. It's a superhero movie. So nothing is really required to make sense.However, the origin story of MW made sense within the realm of fantasy and comics. Actually, it made a lot of sense.The villain was not as developed, but at least you could understand how he became a villain, and why was he doing what he was doing.The support characters are just part of the plot, and not really that important at this moment for this story. In any case, a nice link up for a second movie.I think the movie was directed, produced and managed quite nicely. Even a bit more than nice, when compared to The Flash (or anything DC but Nolan's Bat or The Joker, though I confess to be a fan of the Peacemaker)I also think it was a better movie than some of the marvel swirl we've tasted. E.g., the eternals, Iron Man 3 (love Kingsley, hate the movie) Thor the Dark World (C'mon) and (please forgive me, all (ALL) of the TV shows. Ms. Marvel sucked so hard. Loki... . Ok. Is entertaining. Secret War made want to kill myself.ON an unrelated note, Marvel seems to prefer quantity over quality. And that's the Disney approach. But WB and DC give you very little quality, and very little quality.To sum up. Long live Sony. Loved all (ALL) of Raimi's Spidey movies. Just because of style.Enjoyed Garfield's SM. Hated it when Gwen died, but I thought a 3rd film would give us MJ.Morbius... OK. Not as great as it could have been. Venom... Oh Lord! More! 2nd Ghost rider was hell. 1st I still like.Remember, that Your favorite spidey, Holland, is part Sony and part (aaaarrrgggg) Disney.Disney has been destroying everything we loved (if you're aprox 50 or less) by turning all the fantasy worlds we loved into something lacking originality or inspiration. In the same way, everybody is doing exactly the same.Darn. This started as an opinion, and is turning into a rant; So let me get back to my main idea.MW is not a bad movie. I enjoyed it. Seen worse. No matter what the media tells you, watch it, and then decide. Regarding movies, that's never a bad idea."
matt-mu,2,Zack Snyder cut required!,"One star for having the guts to release an obviously flawed movie.One star for the main actors: Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor, and a node to Tahar Rahim and Adam Paul ScottDirection, production, story and screenplay are all woeful. Particularly direction and production. Maybe it was all doomed by committee?!If Sony wants this franchise to become something, I'd withdraw the release and do a Zack Snyder remake immediately! These are talented actors and the story has unrealised potential. What a let down!I don't know if Sony just can't help itself, but it needs to get out of its own way."
shannah-1,3,Superhero movie with no superheroes,"Boring with poor acting. The actor playing the bad guy is absolutely terrible. (You can't even call him a super villain because other than wanting to kill the girls before they kill him, he doesn't do anything bad, or have any evil plans. One time he's mildly threatening to his minion. He's only interested in saving his own life.)The script is dull and it's the first superhero movie that does not have a superhero in it. I think the whole thing is just a giant ad for Pepsi and a PSA for the American Heart Association about the importance of knowing CPR. And now, because I picked this stinker, my husband gets to pick the movie for a while."
casukstorf,4,Some of the worst super hero movie dialogue. Lots of cringe,"This movie was rough. I didn't have any expectations coming in, but was still disappointed. The premise is interesting, but the execution was way off. Given the powers, it had an opportunity to be cool and badass, but it just missed the mark.Things that were good:
-Cassie's power is cool. She can see the future and change it before its too late, but there's no time traveling confusion going on.-The idea of a professor X sort of school could be interesting if the writing is improved.-The deja vu stuff was confusing at the beginning, but cleared up and was interesting by the end (except what is said below). I think it's supposed to be confusing at the beginning though, to show how confusing it was for Cassie.Things that were bad:
-probably the worst developed villain I've seen in awhile. The main villain has absolutely no motive or backstory. Why did he want the spider in the first place? What does he do with the powers? Why is he so rich? Why is he so angry, when he clearly got the spider he wanted?-The dialogue was crazy cringy. Between the girls, Cassie, and the villain and his assistant, they all had cliche lines that were delivered poorly. This is no more evident than in the last scene when Cassie is in the wheelchair. After that scene, we groaned and left before seeing the post credits.-The final fight scene was supposed to be the ultimate climax, but it wasn't executed well. They were going for a cool scene where she finally can use her premonitions more freely, but it was so chaotic that it fell kinda flat for me. Maybe it was the music or maybe the villain, but the scene just came off as cheesy instead of Badass."
jeffreybowman,1,Madame Webb let down,"I'm at a loss of words. This movie is awful, I can't believe Dakota Johnson signed off on this film. The story is very dull and makes no sense, we bounce from the Amazon at the start with no explanation why. Suddenly we are in New York riding in an ambulance with one of the actors and once again there is no explanation and poof we are thrown into a scene where I think the Bad guy is trying to hook up with a woman whom we don't know where she came from of course she's a government agent and she contains the secret password to unlock all the secret cameras in the city so spider guy can find them."
mdmominulislam-68549,1,"Disappointingly Derivative: A Review of ""Madaem""","As a cinephile always on the lookout for innovative storytelling and fresh narratives, I eagerly anticipated ""Madem."" However, my excitement quickly dissipated within the first few minutes of the film.""Madem"" fails to deliver anything remotely engaging or original. Instead, it feels like a mishmash of tired tropes and clichés stitched together with subpar acting and uninspired direction.One of the most glaring issues with ""Madem"" is its lack of character development. The protagonist is a cookie-cutter rendition of every revenge-seeking vigilante we've seen countless times before. There's nothing compelling or nuanced about her journey; she simply moves from one revenge set-piece to another without any real depth or motivation.Moreover, the supporting cast adds little to the narrative. Their performances are wooden at best, with dialogue so stilted it's almost painful to endure. It's as if the actors themselves couldn't muster any enthusiasm for the project, and it shows in every scene.Visually, ""Madem"" is equally unimpressive. The cinematography lacks imagination, opting for generic shots that do nothing to enhance the story or atmosphere. Even the action sequences, which should be the film's saving grace, feel choreographed and uninspired.Perhaps most disappointing is the wasted potential of the premise. A story centered around a female protagonist seeking revenge in a male-dominated underworld could have been a captivating exploration of power dynamics and gender politics. Instead, ""Madem"" reduces itself to mindless violence and gratuitous scenes that add nothing of substance to the narrative.In conclusion, ""Madem"" is a forgettable addition to the genre that offers nothing new or noteworthy. Its lack of originality, poor character development, and uninspired execution make it a film that's best avoided. Save yourself the disappointment and invest your time elsewhere."
Cruz1014,3,Worst villain ever,"So yes this bombed hard. I don't blame any of the female actresses or anyone else that had a semi significant role, they did what they could with what they were given. With that said the writers were bad. Even more so while I give credit to everyone (actors) for trying to make a decent film, that does not include the guy who played the villain Spider-Man. He was a horrible actor and destroyed that role. I don't know how they went through this film and thought yea this good stuff with him. He should've been replaced. The writers too after Sony reviewed it. I watch all things Marvel so I had to watch it whether it's going to be apart of the bigger story or not in the Spiderman/Venom universe."
shoobe01-1,7,"Better than typical superhero fare, and nearly great","The bad:
The villain. I mean, this is the killer for me. He is a generic beardy guy, and is generically a villain because... shrug? Why is he bad? Why is he SO bad? HOW is he bad? He appears to be a single guy with Corvette money who has like one contract lackey and is charming enough to get his way maybe but... weak. Super duper week, do not care and if you want to complain about writing, this is where all the bad writing went. ""Those girls cannot exist! They will try to destroy me!"" Etc.Mediocre:
Too much handholding, as with almost all movies in the last 20 years or so. We get exposition, flashbacks, cuts to the bad guys doing their thing when The Character Doesn't Know That. This would have been stronger if it had skipped the entire 1970s exposition and done it all in that halfway thru the movie time when they show half of it anyway.Everything else:
Good!I liked the fight scenes, I liked how the confusing precognition matches how the character perceives it, I like how a bunch of what is happening is not explained right away for a change.I... guess, that a lot of the hate is weird Spiderman fanbois and anyone who hates girls (esp three teen girls, some POC) in their comfortably cheeto-dust covered Comic Book Guy world."
smsbygjxyy,3,Unrealized potential,"This movie could have been a truly unique addition to the Marvel universe, but it was betrayed by a horrendous script that was compounded by atrocious acting by almost all of the actors associated with this production.In addition to these initial missteps, the story telling lacked a clear direction and seemed to skip around in an attempt to move the thin plot along in a clear effort to put the production out of its misery. Both the actor playing the villain and the one playing the heroine seemed to have no feel for how to portray their characters and were clearly miscast into the rolls. I kept thinking the villains dialogue was being dubbed.All and all this was a failure that I and seemingly everyone else that viewed it - have now come to realize."
cristybobot,10,Exciting movie,"Level up for followers of marvel, exciting movie you want to watch with someone you care be excited with, you want to know what's next what's her special powers would be liked, is she has bigger powers than others can you and also how she deals with villains or is she is the villain, the character is levelled up to a new stream of story that is different from other superhero , the action scene is spontaneous and also will keep you want hing nomdull moment as if you want to have the same powers, middle age will relate to this movie and the old ones too because she can change what happen a thing all of us want to do."
amandamunk,7,Not the worst...,"Pros. Love the women banding together, it's always a plus. My daughter loved this movie. The potential to see more powerful women in future is cool, I hope the girls all get another movie that is maybe more action. I enjoyed the fireworks scene, and loved that Ben played Ben!Cons. The dubbing of the dude was extremely annoying and I don't think the actor brought enough uniqueness to the role to warrant dubbing instead of replacement. The plot was tough to follow and took a long time to get to the point. Also, while she did nothing wrong in the film, I generally do not enjoy Emma Roberts.Overall it was fine. Not my favorite. Not my least favorite. Will probably watch it again."
Norman_French,4,Weak in every respect,"This film starts off slow, is watchable for awhile, but then has a contrived and disappointing ending. Given I LIKE the precognition concept (and even the casting of Dakota Johnson), this was quite a let-down. I feel like a sucker for watching this. None of the characters felt like real people.Despite official Marvel approval, this film seems full of missed opportunities. I didn't buy the concept of fighting a dark Spiderman with advanced parlor tricks -- it's cute enough for sidekick action, but there needs to be a physically capable hero in the mix. If not, well, you end up with a film like this. Did no one at Sony realize this?The trio-of-girls-with-powers thing has already been done, and it's made worse by the shameless marketing of a sequel at the end. Apparently Cassandra Webb is the female Nick Fury in this universe (face-palm). To be clear, I LIKE strong female characters (see many of James Cameron's films), but this cartoonish politically-correct stuff is quite tiresome.I give this 5.5 stars for superficial entertainment, with half-star penalties for the weak story, poor pacing, and lame ending. That's four (4) stars total."
lmahesa,3,So... this happened.,"Let me preface this by saying that I am VERY forgiving when it comes to movies. I appreciated the ambition that was Eternals. I saw the inklings of a good story hidden inside The Marvels. I thoroughly appreciate Sharknado.Also, I don't read comics so I don't give a damn about canon and I don't know what happened in them.Watching this, I could only wonder at what was there before all the edits, as I believe those edits are responsible for much of the film's woes.The acting, overall, was fine. Some of the talent really tried - perhaps those not in the loop regarding the overall script. I can't comment on the big bad guy, because I can't tell if that's really his voice or not. If it is, he needs to look into a different career.The action was passable, but lacklustre due to poor cinematography and logic failures.Yet again we have a studio trying to force-kickstart a franchise without bothering to do the hard work - DC tried it, Universal tried it. But, hey, Sony can't go wrong, right? Welp.The shame is, this movie isn't just bad on its own. It dilutes and taints anything associated with it. Now Uncle Ben has prior knowledge of 'spider powers'. Now Spider-Man isn't so special. Now those spiders are effectively slot-machines, dishing out random powers to their victims. Peter getting his particular powers was just a random dice roll.So, I guess that's on-brand for Marvel and Disney these days. Release some poorly thought-out crap that wrecks everything before and after because what possible tension can there be if characters like Captain Marvel or Rey exist?I didn't write this to jump on the bandwagon. I wrote this because I'm just sad. I miss the good old days."
ramlymail,1,oh God.. i will remember the name. SJ clarkson.,"Oh God..where should i start..perhaps i'll start with SJ clarkson bcs i dont know who to blame other than the first name that pops up at the end.I thought patty jenkins's last wonder woman is bad.But this? This is another level of bad. I never see something like this. This is new. This is historical. Something you will experience once in a lifetime. The worst ever in every aspect.How.. what the.. why.....
how in the hell this clarkson is allowed to produce even anything? If she can. Then perhaps me finding dragon balls isnt impossible anymore?Sigh..
seeing someone as dumb as the producer able to create this kind of massive thing is trully injustice to every artist that lives.I hope this clarkson never ever create anything anymore for the sake of humanity."
zoltakov,1,"Worst movie of my life,","I've seen every single Spider-Man movie, every single Marvel movie, and I'm the biggest fan of superhero movies. There have been some bad Marvel movies, some bad Sony movies, but I didn't care, I'm a fan, I watch them and I'm glad there's a lot of them in cinemas.But Madame Web is in a different category of bad movies, absolutely unwatchable movies. Just so terrible characters, bad acting, that I had to rewind the movie for the first time in my life.The hairs stood up on the back of my neck as the actors moved around, not caring what their roles were and carrying the deadly weak story. What was the point of this film? Nothing.Deplorably awful is a good term for this movie."
lisafordeay,4,Oh boy was this a real turkey for 2024,"Madame Webb is a 2024 Supernatural Thriller starring Dakota Johnson (Fifty Shades Of Grey),Sydney Sweeney(Anyone But You),Isabela Merced(Dora And The Lost City Of Gold),Celeste O Connor,Tahar Rahim,Emma Roberts,Adam Scott and Kerry Bischè.The story starts off in 1976 and we see a young pregnant woman named Constance(Bischè) who is fascinated with this unique spider at the rainforest. However a deranged man(Rahim) who was accompanying her,kills her and she ends up being resurrected by a spider like man who delivers the baby girl.Fast forward to 2003 and Cassandra Webb(Johnson) is now a paramedic working with Ben Parker(Scott). However she starts to develop telepathic powers where she can sense when danger is ahead.Meanwhile the man that killed her mother in 1976 is out for revenge and is dragging 3 young girls into it(Merced,Sweeney and O'Connor)where Cassie befriends. Will they stop the bad guy once and for all?.Overall it was a very silly movie that made zero sense as the film is connected to Spiderman/Peter Parker and the filmmakers mention that Peter was born in late 2003 yet the OG Peter was born in 1985?. The acting was average,the story was ridiculously bad and the special effects was up there with Spiderman 3. As for the Villian he was just terrible.Somewhere in here is a good movie,but unfortunately it's just not good. The Razzies are definetly coming for this film in 2025."
leoalexanderscott,4,Should have been a tv series.,"With the popularity of streaming services including dedicated Disney Marvel catalogue, there needs to be a clear decision if a heroine story will be embraced on the big screen before commitment to a substantial budget. It seems Sony is a thorn with ambition to milk the spider-verse. Madame Web is the next venture and what a disaster that has been delivered to Marvel fans, Spidey fans and the impressionable younger newer generation coming through. The movie is bad without the toxicity of upset fandoms. No doubt this movie will be remembered for its bad reviews as did DC's 2004 Catwoman.The movie felt like the script been dusted and cobwebs brush aside from the 1980s vaults. The script was so 1980's A-B storytelling it was straight-forward ""insert here"" character situation. In addition, the script only update was nicking bits from other movies.There is sexualisation of three younger heroines for perverted pleasures for teen boys instead of using a brilliant opportunity to deliver admirable strong female role models. Thus, remain cardboard cutouts throughout the whole film. A similar problem was also with associates with both Madame and the villain Sims, they just go nowhere (or simply vanished) when they could have easily had stronger dialogue in the plot and been there right through to the end.In conclusion, I felt like I was watching a possible tv series but instead I had to endure basic A-B plot jammed into two hours. I tried to enjoy the movie, but it was just a massive disaster."
hwvghbf,7,Honestly not as bad as I thought it was going to be,"I decided to see this movie last minute last night and my expectations were on the floor. I haven't seen a marvel film in years and knew next to nothing about this movie going in. All I knew was that the reviews were TERRIBLE and the acting was supposed to be awful. Now I enjoy watching ""so bad they're entertaining"" films from time to time so I wasn't expecting an amazing story or award winning performances. Maybe my enjoyment of the film stems front the fact of low expectations and the fact that the last two movies I saw in theaters were Night Swim and Mean Girls (which not only had bad acting but we're boring.) And I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The acting is not great and the story is all over the place. The main villain's acting and line delivery really took me out of the experience. But I have to admit, I was pretty entertained! I didn't really know what was going to happen next, and while the climax felt lack luster, I can't say I was bored. I think the tie in with Peter Parker being born at the end of the film could've been more prevalent to the story- but that could just be because I'm not that familiar with the universe and didn't pick up on it sooner. I don't regret watching this, but probably won't see it again."
rygar75,2,Watching in disbelief,I can't even believe how boring this movie is. Did the writers make a bet to see if they could make the most boring movie of all time? The script is just unfathomably awful. I'm kind of impressed with the actors that they were even able to go through with it. Even the action scenes were somehow just not very engaging I guess because I really didn't care what happened at that point. It's not even a movie you can just put on to have something random in the background. You will want to turn it off. The general premise seemed interesting at first glance but it did not deliver anything of the sort.
kennycf,9,"Suspenseful, funny, cool visuals, Yes!","I think the biggest problem people had with this movie is that they came in expecting an avengers movie. I thought the movie was really good (I could even say it's my favorite superhero movie). The girls are so funny, the way they picture the future vision is so so amazing and the story is actually entertaining. The escaping scenes were exciting, as were the fighting scenes. All in all, this is a movie that you should at least watch to make your own opinion.I hate how people focus so much on the critics' opinions and make them their own without even giving the movie a chance. At the very least, I can assure you, the movie is not as bad as everyone is painting it to be. Maybe you'll not find it as awesome as I do, but big chances are that you'll think it's not that bad."
stevendbeard,6,A Little Disappointing,"I saw Madame Webb, starring Dakota Johnson-The Peanut Butter Falcon, the Fifty Shades movies; Tahar Rahim-Napoleon, Day of the Falcon; Adam Scott-Big Little Lies_tv, Krampus and Sydney Sweeney-Euphoria_tv, The White Lotus_tv.This is a super hero movie based on characters from the Spider_Man comic books. Normally, I love super hero movies, but I was a little disappointed here. Dakota plays Cassandra Webb, a paramedic, and Adam is her partner. Dakota's mother was in the Amazon, researching spiders and how their venom could help fight medical diseases-she was also pregnant with Dakota at the time. Tahar plays Ezekiel Sims, who was with Dakota's mother but left the Amazon without her. But he did take some of her research. Tahar builds an empire with his special powers he gained from the research but has visions of 3 girls-dressed up as Spider_Women-fighting and killing him in the future. So he decides to kill the 3 girls before they get enhanced. Dakota starts having visions too and tries to help the 3 girls. Sydney is one of the 3 girls. There are lots of loop holes in the plot and some things not explained. There is no scene during or after the end credits.It's rated. PG-13 for violence/action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.Like I said earlier, I usually love super hero movies but I don't know if I would buy it on DVD. It would be alright to stream."
angetroy,3,Unless you have something better to watch....,"It had a bit of promise but the writing and dialogue was soooooo bad!! The beginning had some hint of mystique so I felt confident and Adam Scott is great so again there was hope....it faded fast. This was a terrible movie. Even with a few potential moments for at least something not obvious they ruined it. It's like they were afraid no one would get it so they spelled it all out instead, couldn't even be original on super landings...it's was like Black Widow legs 101!!! Come on guys - surely this should have been scrapped in pre production. What a waste of money!! Time, film, suits...brain cells..."
johnnyreinsch,2,Comedy gold,"Do not watch unless you enjoy bad films*This felt so badly rushed and the direction was awful. The villains lines all sounded like a dubbed film. He's also the worst fighter ever. Let me just wait for you to kick my butt.I could definitely go on.Pacing was the one thing that was good.Although to become super powerful she just had to accept responsibility. No practice, understanding, or adversity needed.My next gripe is the weird personality shift. Our lead has a personality the whole film. Once the climax hits and after accepting responsibility and becoming the most powerful for individual she is some weird soft spoken mother figure...Again the writing pure comedy."
reneewalter,1,Womp womp,"Kept thinking about Wonder Woman 84... sort of as a mental check in if that was still the worst movie of all time? Yes, it is. But damn this felt close at times. Writing was poor, direction was lacking. I felt bad for the actresses. I think it might have been ok as a cartoon. So much backstory and yet somehow none of the connections and emotions feel deep or real? I thought the entire movie was going to be backstory at one point. SO slow and far too long. It was comical at times, but certainly not in the ways it was intended to be. I didn't waste my money on it but sure did waste my time. I'm certain I could find fourth graders who could have written a a more entertaining story. Could be good to fall asleep to though!"
elated-firefly,2,"Poor story, poor visuals, poor dialogue and $100 million to waste","So it is not a movie for teens, it's not a chick flick, it is not eye candy movie for men, it's not an action movie, it's not gritty, it's not funny, it's not romantic. So what is it? The best explanation is that someone took a lot of money and they just needed to produce something to justify the spending.It's the same stupid story over and over again, but somehow they make it worse every time. The CW made dozens of tv shows that are better than this and that says a lot.The movie does not have anything substantial in it. No purpose, no main theme, no likable characters. Someone decided to cast Sydney Sweeney and make her a dork, the most boring and unmemorable character. The villain is so basic that it feels like they forgot to write him in and had to think of something in last minute."
chiapet-25426,4,What a tangled web we weave...,"'Madame Web' is an utterly unnecessary superhero film, loosely based on a fairly obscure character in the Spider-man universe. It joins the growing niche of ""Spider-man movies without Spider-man"" produced by Columbia Pictures, which includes 2018's 'Venom', 2023's 'Morbius' and the as-yet unreleased 'Kraven'.'Madame Web' is a watchable bad movie. Dakota Johnson plays Cassie Webb, an NYC paramedic who is ambivalent and coldly detached from her profession of saving lives. She hasn't yet learned that with great power comes great responsibility. An accident knocks her into the East River, which somehow triggers a penchant for clairvoyance. Clearly this isn't the most logical origin story in the annals of comic book movies.The story picks up with Cassie on a commuter train and envisioning an assassin killing three young ladies. The non-descript Baddie is in the next train car and heading Cassie's way. Ruh-roh.Much of the film is Cassie playing reluctant Mother Hen to the trio, played by Sidney Sweeney, Isabel Merced and Celeste O'Connor. We glean that the three are budding heroes in waiting if this franchise can get off the ground.But that doesn't seem likely as this film never takes off. The burning question is: who thought it was a good idea to produce a stand-alone film based on Madame Web?I did appreciate some on-location scenes shot in New York City, including some face time for two of my favorite neighborhoods in Queens: Astoria and Long Island City.During the press junket for 'Web', Dakota Johnson freely admitted that she hasn't watched the film and has no plans to. So even Madame Web isn't a fan of 'Madame Web'."
shenamere,3,Grade School And Then...,"A group of Grade school students could have written a better story and probably better acted this as well. Every plot element is a cliche or copied from countless similar movies. Then the hopelessly optimistic stunts where only the bad people get hurt. The movie has the standard attempts at emotion grabbers with impending births, deaths and daring feats of mindless adventure. The exotic settings to helpless, needy, emotion laden, but more capable than they know teens. Who can resist the concept of normal people being transformed into super heroes who really don't need their super powers to be super human-beings! Give it a pass unless it's raining outside and you have extra crisps and popcorn to waste."
nanny_pilot,7,Haters gonna hate,"Haters gonna hate. Every time there's a movie where most of the main characters are female this happens. That and/or reviews are left by trolls who didn't watch the movie but just think that the movie was gonna suck balls.I thought the movie was fast paced, entertaining, so much better than Morbius and better than I thought it would be.I know that some people are getting tired of super hero movies but I think that this movie is a nice change of pace. It reminded be a bit of X-men and final destination. I really hope they do have a second part to it to find out what happens to the all the characters."
laurabadcock-56283,5,The writing and direction was horrific,"This movie would have been fine if there was a flow. The writing was the worst I've watched in a long time. The direction was just awful, I was in awe at it. I haven't looked up the writers or the director to see how it was but it was super obvious they were all just taking a paycheck and had zero interest in their job. It's a shame because this could have been something. I'm giving it a very generous 5 because the actors did their best with really poor lines. You could tell a couple of the teen girl actors were tired of their same lines. It was just shocking. I'm saddened that marvel could have allowed for This horrible writing and direction ."
edg19,10,Don't understand the hate.,"I went in thinking the movie wasn't going to be good because of all the hate it's received but the movie was good and entertaining. I seriously do not understand the hate this movie is getting. I have seen serious bore fests like the movie Napoleon but this movie had action throughout the whole film. The movie didn't have that dumb and forced marvel humor at all which was a plus for me. I also like all of the throwback stuff like the music, how cellphones were just starting to be something a regular person has and the references to Spider-Man. If you are not into or obsessed with superhero movies give this movie a chance you won't be disappointed."
malmevik77,7,Don't listen to the haters. This is not a superhero film so don't expect one.,"Madame WebA Spider-man adjacent film, put out by Sony, (ugh when is that contract over), Madame Web, takes a more obscure character from the Marvel comics and produces an origin story. As a reader of the books, I unfortunately had a small bias going into the theater. Of course, characters have been revamped to make a more interesting story, and they introduced some more recent characters in the comics, the three girls.The year is 2003. A 30 something paramedic named Cassie Webb suddenly starts seeing events in the future, but she has no control over what she sees. This leads her down the rabbit hole of finding out her past including her mother's obsession with spiders, and a seemingly immortal man, Ezekiel, obsessed with visions of his own death at the hands of the girls.An amazing set of coincidences brings the 4 women together that has plausibility but is a bit forced, but I can go with that. The film felt very much like a comic book with some of the action having to be moved along a bit quicker than reality just to get on with the story.What follows is a little bit of a slow, clunky middle section of the movie as Cassie tries to understand what's going on, while the three girls act like unruly teenagers calling the attention of Ezekiel.The subplot involving Cassie's paramedic partner, Ben and his pregnant sister-in-law Mary, was inserted with amazing subtlety and it has a huge connection to the MCU, though not specifically named.I liked the movie for the dive into Cassie's evolving mental state, a fresh take on her origin instead of the comic book's version of constant paralysis, and what could be the beginning of Spider-Man spinoffs in the form of recent comic book adaptations of female versions of the character. Cassie's character development was very impressive going from grouchy selfish loner to someone who takes the great power which comes with great responsibility. The Spider-Man references were so well written into the script, I can forgive some of the awkward acting.Oh and a shout out to Sydney Sweeney who is in literally everything right now. I think I've seen her in 5 or 6 films and tv series. Girl, you do you, I'm here for it.Unfortunately, I don't think the movie is going to do well in theaters due to the obscurity of the story, and the fact not much really happens with the teenagers. The preview implied much more action with them than you see. Go see it knowing that it truly is about Madame Web herself, and you'll enjoy it."
mattstevensk,5,DIDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE AT ALL,"Honestly, I've been watching some parts of the movie, but there's something missing about this movie. First, it's the lack of body language the actresses were using, but I give props to Dakota Johnson for her efforts tho. Second, the script was poorly written and misunderstood, OMG. I don't even know what is going on when I'm trying to follow the plot of what is supposed to happen. I have never, of the long term love I've had with the Marvel universe, ever came across a film that is bland and confusing. I'll tell you what, the film belongs in one place and one place only. I tell you - trash. 😤"
derekpoland,3,Fast F does not help - super hero movies are getting worse,"Disclaimer - I liked Morbius. Apologies to one and all. I don't much care for Leto but didn't find the movie so bad.Madame Web, however...Started to watch at normal speed when I realised this would not go well. Decided to fast forward to the good bits...no good bits. Did not finish the movie.The problems are vast with this one. Acting, dialogue, character ark for Madame Web, the 3 'John Connors' she took it upon herself to guard, a spider ish man who could finish off everyone except MW and her 3 useless hangers on. Apparently the original screenplay had spider woman saving Aunt May's baby or something. After a tonne of rewrites they settled for this pile of poop. Even the star said the finished product was unrecognisable from the original screenplay she read.Instead of funding such monstrocities, why not just give the cash to charity? Or give the project to someone who knows what they are doing? I've just finished watching Mr Inbetween - 3 seasons in a week binged. I'm going to watch it all again.To use a line from Shaun of the Dead - ""Sort your effing life out Sony."""
fitchaj-1,3,It a good stepping stone,"I came in to this with a open mind. People like to complain about everything, so I do not listen. Ok it not flashy and not very action packed, But look at it as a stepping stone to a crisis on infinite earths(yes I know it marvel not dc) type film or something better then multiverse of madness tried to do.We just need to have a open mind and try and see what would come out of the story and not what is just thrown at you. Yes every one say the writing could be better, but I would like to see what the could do.If we could see a second film with the same cast and find the right villain for the group and a good cross over story with a different universe...well we do have America Chavez, you never know.JUST OPEN YOUR MIND PEOPLE, try... what mite happen not what is there in front of you. If we all say something they mite listen. STRANGER THINGS HAVE HAPPENED."
nogodnomasters,5,It sure feels like a kidnapping,"The film opens in 1973 as Constance Webb (Kerry Bishé) with a child, is looking for a legendary peptide-producing spider in the Amazon Forest of Peru. Upon discovering said spider she is shot by Ezekiel Sims (Tahar Rahim) and robbed of the spider. She dies and 30 years later her daughter Cassandra Webb (Dakota Johnson) is an EMT. After a near-death experience, she discovers she can see into the future and can change things. While on public transportation she has a vision of dark Spiderman and rescues three nubiles (Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, Celeste O'Connor) from certain death.This was the film that established the characters should they attempt to make another one. Who doesn't want to see more of Sydney Sweeney? The problem I had with this feature was the shallow plot as well as presenting future views. The special effects of this were not up to par with what I would expect from a Marvel film. I did love the name Cassandra Webb.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
Welikefortniteandminecraft,1,WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"This is the most frustratingly agonizing movie I've ever watched in my entire life. I'm not exaggerating, it's absolutely horrible in every single way conceivably possible. I could go on for DAYS about everything wrong with it and still barely even scratch the surface. There aren't enough words in the English language that can even begin to describe just how bad it is. It is an ATROCITY. It is an insult to everything in humanity, to the point where you can't even physically think straight at all. The editing makes it feel like you're flying around on a helicopter blade at full speed. The dialogue and acting makes it feel like you're watching a Dhar Mann video, except that's an insult to Dhar Mann. Think of the worst movie you've ever seen in your entire life. Okay, that movie is the literal GODFATHER compared to this heap of immeasurable trash. It is entirely UNWATCHABLE. It is purely inconceivable that a movie can physically be this bad, it just breaks all human understanding and comprehension. There isn't a single redeeming quality in this in any way at all. Never ever, EVER watch even a single second of this complete and total disaster."
aryansharma-52591,1,Marvel❌ - marvale👍🏼,"You know what marvel I really don't want to see these superheroes again I really feel more respectful to Batman despite not having any superpowers, this is the worst movie ever created by marvel, you should give the award for best actor to o niel because he's is the only character that people gonna find pleasant till it's end and what the hell is wrong with actors did you guys give them Mac Donalds happy meal instead of payment. And the villain I mean why did you hate spidey so much he has spider powers but cant use webbs fine, he can't use sixth sense this is fine too, but he's fast right then why the hell he can't doge and the end scene who designed the costume for Cassie seems like 4th grade production film of 1950s
😭😭I waste my 2 hours
If you are reading this review don't be concerned about spoilers this movie doesn't has a story."
lauragullery,7,So over hated...,"Madame web was a fun watch and deserves more love because it had character development, nice shots, some comedy here and there, and good action scenes. The only problems was that it didn't feel like a marvel movie yet it is more Sony. The ending felt a bit confusing/blurry to understand and to keep up with but overall Dakota Johnson played Madame Web/Cassie so well while the girls played regular teenagers which was fine. I would have loved if they made it so that either Andrew or Tobeys Peter had a small cameo putting this movie in one of their universes but I did love watching 4 girls as spider-heroes!! This movie is definitely over hated just like The Marvels... Seeing the reviews made me worry but after watching it was pretty good so please DON'T let reviews ruin a movie before seeing it. Watch it and judge it on your own."
riveravaldez,3,Fast Sell Goes Wrong,"Script seems like a rushed draft made to prepare the sell of a sequel saga, something like the spider-girls X-Men, with its own Teacher X, wheelchair and all.There's no love in the making. There are too many characters to introduce and zero character development. There were too many accidents to force the plot in some forced direction and zero causality to made all that into a logical and necessary concatenation. Like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles prequel made just to introduce the product, a known product, so, a pure formality. Because, nobody cares...
Sad, 'cause first half hour is entertaining, and the casting ain't that bad. Dakota is fine, etc. But the lack of interest and respect for the whole concept was an original production sin impossible to force into a film format.Indeed it looks like the ""zero"" episode of a TV-series. Not a good one, but in that case maybe an excusable one, provided that the series went far better.Money grab is a waste of audiences time."
hehh-04552,10,Whatever anyone say this is bad movie,"Whatever who hate madame web
It was so good for me
I think this is just normal superhero story and kinda littlebit make me cry
Whatever everyone says this movie is bad, madame web is my fav hero movie
I wanna say dont be scared try to watch it
I didnt expect much from the ratings but it was really fun the whole time
All the actor in this movie is sooo cool

I dont know why many peoples hate this movie
Im Sydney sweeney fan but not only sydney but also other actors acting was so good and make me cryIts just my opinion but it was good and fun
Whatever who hate this movie i love this."
ajwood-45602,7,An unexpected good time!,"So I expected this film to be awful because of the reviews. The reviews are not fair at all, i genuinely had a really fun time.Dakota Johnson was really strong in this, she did great.There was barely any cgi which was really refreshing. It's a simple story. The early 2000s vibes were fun.I liked the nods to the toby maguire films but liked this was its own thing.The professor x type moment at the end was really camp and cheesy, the glasses made me laugh (probably unintentionally funny).But yeah, give this a go. Way better than expected and was nice it wasn't a cgi mess which for superhero films is a change."
SarsaParilla_Sunrise,5,Final Destination This Aint,"I went for a middle rating, it wasn't as bad as anticipated and sure enough, some of the dialogue was so rogue it had roadkill all over it, and there was promise in places. I liked the Final Destination spin and I'd be interested to see how the young girls transition into their own super powers. The character of Madam Web needs to end with this film and remain a scant mention in the future, IF there is going to be a future. I'm doubtful. I wonder if the writers had a cereal bowl of E numbers after a night of dropping tabs before writing this. They need a healthier diet and we, the viewer, deserve a lot better."
justinwilliams371,3,Not even a B movie,"A lot of superhero films are getting some bad reviews at the moment, maybe through fatigue with the whole genre so I like to see for myself and make my own judgement. Well, I wish I hadn't bothered as this was awful.It felt so awkward, amateurish and disjointed. The dialogue was robotic, like they had just been given their lines about 2 minutes before each scene, speech lacked any fluidity.The acting was about as awful as it could be, awkward pauses like they were waiting for prompts from the side on what to do next.The storyline was concocted by a teenager, it made no sense if you look at it critically. The whole ""I can see the future"" was just used as a Deus Ex Machina solution to everything.Please don't make a sequel."
kumaran-j-pagan,2,The Name of the movie is the Clairvoyant not the ... er ... character?,"Okay, the movie is bad not because of the acting and characters but because too much of the story is broken. The movie sort of brings real-flight-or-fight responses an average person would have to a life-or-death situation but the story is a shattered mirror. The antagonist is a mysterious rich guy with sort of guess abilities who taints the Spider-Superhero? The protagonist is a hardcore loner who suddley gets the protective instinct because of stange situation and abilities manifested quite recently? (must be her time of the month). The three apprentices are really shown more like an eye candy than the potential super-heroine types.These are the building blocks of a good story, Sadly the story has no strong foundation. The story does not have any random aspects which would mesh together in the climax. It alienates the story teller with the audience. Lack of right pizzaz. The characters as their own would have done far better.I liked the promise of the franchise. Do I like as it is now, sadly no i do not. I guess the project would have done better as a series, where each character gets their origin story told in each episode and gets the story going later. As a movie too much is omitted the story left is full of cliches and underated scenes and broken promises."
BadSwon,4,Jesus Christ....,"I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO WRITE....
It's difficult for me write something negative about a piece of art but...: Everything about this movie sucks ass. You guys had an amazing cast and this is the result?? Shame on you, what the hell do you need for a ""passable"" film???? You had possibly the hottest woman on earth at the moment, capable actors and this is what you come up with? All you had to do is write a few simple superhero lines and it would have been in the bag, BUT NO....:you had to supersize it.....Just look for an another field of work, that's all. Otherwise you're simply wasting time and space."
imransiam,1,This movie is a disrespect to all women,"In one line this is the worst super hero movie ever made.There is new trend going on in the movie genre, if something is already hit or established make female version of that. This movie followed the same path and fall into that trap. In addition to that meaningless storyline, crap direction, worst acting, 'D' grade animation all makes a perfect movie disaster. I really feel for those people who bough tickets and stayed at the cinema hall. At least I had the opportunity to pause couple of time to cool down and finish it. They were clueless when they signed up for this one. Just making something a female version like this is pure disrespect towards all women. This trend should be stopped."
jamfitz001,4,Doomed by a DEI Director Choice,"I am not sure what is so difficult to understand about the basics of Comic books.1. The Silver Age of the 1960s was the high point of the industry, with Marvel and DC both selling a fistful of characters that got 500K units per month.2. Those stories were aimed at young boys who liked Superheroes.When the comics moved into the 1970s...sales declined.I understand that Sony needs to produce a Marvel product so many years to hang to character rights it purchased when Marvel was down and busted in the 1990s. So that company has more or less pushed out product without the care for detail and story and consistency that we've seen from the MCU.So...here's a concept, let's take a 1980 Marvel character that was never overly popular and then hand it to SJ Clarkson, who never read a comic book in her life. She could care less about the underlying concepts or psychology driving Comic Book movies. This is about a lady who comes to term with her mom and then helps 3 girls because this some girl power story or something.I saw this with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins. Women are being given the opportunity to helm 'major pictures' ...go girls....but when you don't understand the Genre...you get Madame Web and durn mediocre Movie that seems like a Lifetime Movie of the week.This story lacks any real humor. It lacks any real emotional commitment between any of the characters. You got a great bunch of talent here and nobody says a damn thing worth remembering. Our heroine is just there. You've got a bunch of gorgeous women and you totally strip them of any sex appeal or charm and make them as generic as you can.SJ Clarkson has probably never seen any of the important movies in this genre in the last twenty years, which is why the action scenes come across like they are from a 1990s movie.When I consider the love, detail, care and obvious thrill of Favreau, Waititi the Russo Brothers, Gunn directing movies in a Genre that they loved and grew up with, and then you compare it to these female directors who are clueless about what Comic Books are about....the problem becomes obvious.These are big budget movies, and obviously equity and social justice in choosing who gets the helm them is a bad idea.I thought most of the actors in this movie are capable of giving you a great experience. This story, and this director just were Kryptonite for a Comic book movie."
romundo-43620,6,From a Non-Comic Book Nerd -I was entertained,"Maybe I got caught up in how things were going to develop with regards to the characters but I didn't find it as bad as a lot of the reviews on here. It's no masterpiece but it did keep me intrigued on how powers were going to develop...maybe if I knew anything about the comics I'd have an opinion like some of the reviewers on here. To me it felt like more of an M Night Shyamalan written superhero movie as opposed to a Marvel movie. I think a lot of people may have been expecting more of the three girls' web powers than what was presented so it was prob a big let down.The chemistry seemed pretty good amongst the main characters (I've only heard of Sweeney and Johnson -never watched their any of their films). That being said, I think it left for a kind of lack luster villain character -it was almost as if he was just a bad guy and not a true villainous antagonist. All in all, I wouldn't mind if there was a sequel to see where things go since this was more of the origin movie but based on the overall reviews it prob wont happen."
charger_jm,1,"sony needs to stop making ""superhero movies""",If you're into watching 4 girls run away from a boring villain then this is the movie for you. Its litterally all they do. Theres no fighting scenes what so ever.The writing and acting is some of the worst i have seen in my life and i have seen freddy gets fingered. This was a horrible movie to sit through.The only good thing i can say is they hired some very pretty girls. All cassie did all movie was hit ezekiel with a taxi and then hit him again with an ambulance. Very boring.Im no writer myself has you can probably see from my review but do trust me when i say do not spend a dime to see this. You will be very dissapointed.
emiliadebaritault,10,Great movie!,Great movie! I don't know what everyone's problem is with this movie. It had me on the edge of my seat. I would definitely recommend watching it. It has a great plot. I must have Madame Web part two. If you are interested in movies to do with seeing into the future I would definitely recommend. It is a great movie to try to understand what is reality. I love how I didn't know at times what she was actually seeing. It was based of the supernatural and makes you wonder what could be put there. I would definitely watch more movies like this. Such a great concept. Also amazing actors and actresses. The casting choice is top notch.
keirondarbyshire,6,Why the hate?,"Okay, this film isn't going to win any awards, but it isn't a one to four star film.There's plenty of films I've aborted because they were garbage & even some of them got a four star review because the production values or the acting were good though the story may have been weak.I feel that this film has been pooh-poohed by enough that everyone else jumps in the hatred bandwagon.It kind of reminds me of John Carter & The Ghosts of Mars. A cracking delight of a film, but it got undeserved hate.Would I watch this film again, probably. I wouldn't put it on because I thought ""oooo, I'd like to watch Madame Webb"", but if someone else was watching it, I'd sit & watch it also.A very deserved six out ten stars from me.It has its flaws, but it's not Morbius or Suicide Squad, that's for sure."
michaelkamotobw,3,THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER!!!,"This is one of the beautifully conceptualized worst movie you will ever watch in Hollywood, it's even hard to start explaining where it went wrong apart from just thinking how did they see it themselves and went like ""okay, this is complete, the audience will enjoy it.""I am fan of marvel movies and I will watch everything they serve, I even do so without looking at the reviews first because I want to get that first-touch experience, but gosh! This movie failed me so much that I actually got fascinated to come and check the reviews properly. The bad ones are those that think this movie is being hated for Sony or Marvel, they give it a high rate consolation. The worse ones are those that think it is hated under misogyny or any social engineered proclivity. Gosh, you are the ones guilty of leading people to lies. Something is bad because it is bad! This movie is good at being that bad!!!However, the concept is promising if given to the right script, acting, cinematography and audio."
richardwoodford-24415,4,"""Spiderman"" reversal","Dakota Johnson makes this watchable, barely.Your suspension of disbelief has to be very strong here:
Her Mom's 9 month pregnant journey into the Peruvian Jungle in 1973; an NSA agent is murdered for her security access code & NSA doesn't investigate OR change their security codes; three teen age girls are ""abducted"" in NYC after a bizarre attack by Aranas-man and it doesn't become a nation-wide search? A NYFD paramedic who can just take off for weeks whilst the subject of the aforementioned abduction. Driving around in a stolen taxi, with no plates in NYC/NJ and no one calls THAT in? Those are just a few of the dozen or so plot holes and weird tropes. The ""Uncle Ben"" line ""With great power comes great responsibility"" is turned on it's head here- but it is there just as Ms. Webb learns that she didn't get all the Spider powers- just ""spidey sense"" and apparently the ability to be in more than one place at the same time. The 3 teen girls are so unlikable & unlikely that you almost are pulling for the bad guy to just not be murdered. The ending has to be seen to be disbelieved. Pepsi paid a lot for this gem."
gabrielgallian,4,okay,"It's ok, not the best work from sony, i might get hate but i kind of enjoyed seeing madame webs powers, they were cool and interesting, just the pace and plot is kind of all over the place, the acting was difficult to watch, great actors but their lines and scripts were horrible, just wish they took more time to evolve the movie, i think it's better than morbius but not a good movie from sony, a movie that had way more potential, i think it takes a type of taste in movies to enjoy this, sÃ³ overall i think it is enjoyable (different from morbius) but it's not for most people. A mediocre but not overall horrible movie."
sbnseattle,2,I really wanted it to be good,"I don't know what happened here but this movie was awful. I wasted 26 dollars on a movie I literally put my head down on the table and said ""Why did I buy this?"" It was young women running for their lives and should left me holding on to the edge of my seat but I went to the bathroom instead without even pausing it. And....to top it all off, the end credits were set to the theme from ""You've Got Mail."" It was boring, poorly written, cheesy and just plain ridiculous at times. I just want to say to the writer and director....""Are you high on something?"" I gave it two stars but I was being really generous with those stars. Just saying....probably best to rent and not buy this one."
tdkhgnt,1,Poor Dakota Johnson,One bad role after another first fifthty shades of gray and now this I mean it's not just her but it literally the poor acting I mean the premise of the movie was very weird and the time travel made no sense too. Also her being able to see into the future randomly made no sense as well as them becoming super heroes as well like what do you mean they got powers at the almost ending of the movie. I love Sydney Sweeney especially her acting on euphoria but this was low even of her. The only good actress was emma Robert's with her probably 5 minutes of screen time with the budget of 80-100 million dollars they could have done better.
tfwcphmm,1,IMPRESSIVELY bad.,"This movie is a heroic masterclass in how NOT to make a movie. Plenty of other reviews have hounded the direction, story, and weak characters. But, just for starters, this was shot on the most technically advanced, industry-favored camera set up (the Arri Alexa Mini LF, Panavision lenses) and they SOMEHOW managed to bake an image that looked like a high school film club's midterm project. I mean, it's just astounding. The color choices are so bizarre, some shots were under exposed and then were ""recovered"" in post, producing a really sophomoric, noisy image. Everything that could have been bad about this was. That's the tip of the iceberg - I have never, in all my years working in the industry, seen ADR this bad. The main villain's voice was re-done in post production, they went with the most bizarre mixed accent, and almost none of his lines matched his mouth movements. His accent changes throughout the film, his delivery sounds like an anime character's. There is no way it wasn't on purpose. This has to be a failed promotional stunt, or a social experiment or something."
zacharylong-51203,7,Fun popcorn flick with flaws,"It wasn't a must-see, but it wasn't bad. There were some poorly written parts in it, primarily in terms of dialogue. All acting was pretty good for the most part except for the parts where the dialogue was poorly written. The actor for Ezekiel Sims wasn't too great unless he was part of the action scenes. The action, and the way it was filmed was pretty fun. The parts that were strong were pretty strong. I think that the primary issue is that it wasn't too ambitious and didn't expand as much as it should've in certain areas. I think, overall, that it was a rather fun watch. I've certainly seen worse films before (*cough* most mass-produced horror films *cough*).To echo other reviews: Saying it is the worst film ever is a gross overstatement, especially when the previous film in this cinematic universe was FAR worse. This film is receiving a lot of hate mostly because there is no Spider-Man in it. This has been the case with the last several films in the franchise: Venom, Venom: Let There Be Carnage, and Morbius. I do believe that as a standalone (which it is) the movie has its own merits, even though it feels constricted by it's hour-and-forty-minute runtime."
radcuban-89875,5,Meh,"You can tell throughout the movie that the cast chemistry wasn't really there, at least between Dakota Johnson and the others, which she admits herself thinking she was too old in comparison and had nothing in common. That itself makes the film take a big hit.As for the movie itself, I think it's bagged on more than it deserves to be, but it won't be the best film you see in any given point in time. The story is a little lackluster, but I was still entertained. People complain about Madame Web not being old, but don't realize this is a coming of age story on how she got her powers (in a Hollywood take). It sets up a sequel, or at least spin off movies with the other characters who appear in costume in a future setting. Sadly, the lack of success makes me believe that'll never come to light."
keepaamai,10,"Great movie that is different to the rest, not your typical hero movie.","I personally enjoyed this movie! Loved the story line, camera action work, casting/ the acting and the setting of the movie for sure from the forests to new york. It was exciting and different with some nostalgia moments set in 2004 ish. At times your kept wandering, but soon come to an understanding as the story progresses. I lived how their was interaction and some refences to the spiderman marvel universe, whilst also maintain its own story in this movie. Their was great action animation work also which helped explain the story.Some timeline moments in the movie was confusing at times, but I think the director done well in this movie to set up for a sequal I feel. I felt the music work could've been a lil better but it still done well to compliment the story. Hopefully all goes well for another movie to be made to tell this story that needs to be told ðŸ™ŒðŸ’¯"
boggysamy,7,Don't be influenced by others,"I used to go by other people's opinions online...but after watching the movie morbius i stopped looking at other people's opinions because they all said it was a very weak movie and i really liked the movie morbius, action by quality.The same can be said about madame web, for a relaxed Saturday in the cinema, the film grabs your attention if you know what it's about and watched the Spiderman cartoons from 1990, the movie has enough action and for the first time they introduced an evil Spider-Man who doesn't speak and kills for his own good. I guess it's interesting to see such a spiderman for the first time7/10."
jaxx-68100,5,CUTE AND BAD,"The storytelling in this movie is awful, but the four young ladies in the starring roles were fun and attractive. The story looked like something contrived by a twelve-year-old. I always feel sorry for actors in poorly thought-out stories; they can only work with what they are given. The bad storytelling is doubly disappointing when I think about the probability that I will not see these lead actors in a better made sequel. The bond that these four young ladies developed by the end of the movie was touching to see.Cassie: ""Yes. They're all mine.""There are many things about this origin-story I would have contrived differently or not at all, but the casting is a keeper. Story is king."
TheNuttyMoviegoer,4,A Mess of a Web,"Is this a 1 star movie, no. Is it a 10? Absolutely not. This film misses on a lot but not everything. The film needs a recast bad, the antagonist is just a miss, and lacks any type of chemistry with the other actors. The ADR work is horrific, often not syncing with mouths. Dakota probably wasn't the best pick but she worked hard with a bad script... ""Now you're showing off"". You get a feeling just from watching that the cast knew this script was poorly written. In many scenes it just felt like they were reading off a page and not having a conversation.The film tried its best to build a backstory but came up a little short. If this movie had 30ish more minutes for story telling that would have went a long way.TLDR: Madame web could have been a 8/10 movie with a recast, 30 extra minutes of story telling and a pretty serious rewrite of some lines. As always Adam Scott was a rock in this film."
slai_fi,1,Green Lantern Bad,I'm honestly shocked by how bad this movie is...........shocked.Horrible acting by literally every person in the film. So bad that it sounded like the movie was dubbed over.Boring story and terribly written.It blows my mind this passed through so many hands before being released and ended up so awful.By far the worst Sony/Marvel movie made to date.The vast majority is absolutely correct on this one and honestly a 3.9/10 is too high a rating for this film.Not sure how well it did in box office but doubtful we'll see anything more from these characters.It's on Netflix and I still paid way too much to see this..........paid with my time.
smokey-36472,7,It was a good start,"I hate when people base reviews on cast and not what the movie is. It was a good movie.SpoilersWhen it came to the visions she had, it was a little confusing on what was actual and what she saw. That could have used a little help but you catch on quickly. Then when it came to Ezekiel, he did need work on his character. He was so obsessed with his lack of things he had growing up that it was not a strong reason for his character to be evil. There could have been more detail in certain parts but it was not a complete loss for a movie. It does set up a good base for future movies and maybe it will be better for those who oppose it."
Gamer1995,9,Madame Web was great. Don't listen to the Marvel trolls.,"Don't listen to the Marvel trolls who crawled out of their mother's caves to write bad reviews.It's almost an episode of What If.What If Spiderman were a villain trying to kill the future women who would become Spiderwomen. And who he dreamed would be responsible for his death.Madame Web is the catalyst who saves these young girls. And who, oddly, can't be seen by the evil Spiderman in the dreams of his death. Madame Web supposedly wasn't supposed to come into the mix.Not only did it change this Spiderman's dreamed demise, it is later revealed why Madame Web isn't in his dream of his death: Madame Web was a terminally ill baby in the womb. Her mother looked for the spider in Peru to save her with its healing properties. This ""evil Spiderman"" was with her to protect her. Instead, he betrayed and killed her, then used the spider to become a Spiderman that is a complete opposite of Peter Parker.The future seeing visions Web has are confusing and drive her to the point of insanity until she starts to learn to control it. It's impossible to kill a seer in a fight, unless they choose death.The visions of the future are very well portrayed. The audience feels the same confusion she has. I haven't seen this since the movie Memento. The twists are pretty good and keep coming into the story. Its only weakness is a few scenes being melodramatic. The Evil Spiderman's dream of his death from the Spiderwomen is full of glaring and posing like a CW show.Luckily, that was not the norm throughout the movie. Web was a good fighter despite being physically outclassed. She would cause chaos to fight the Spiderman. At one point, setting a fireworks factory on fire so he would get by all of its shrapnel and, since she can see the future very well by this point, just dodges or blocks the debris. I also love the final ability of her power. It involves changing the future from 3 perspectives. She can be in 3 places at once. It made me think of the technical ways she could use this power. Like perhaps making her strength increase 3x by her 3 selves being focused at the same point. Possibly even 4x if you count her body where her 3 selves comes from.I loved this film. I don't know what these Marvel fans want. It has a great plot that just keeps going. My only grudge is we didn't get to see the 3 Spiderwomen manifest their powers. But, we do get to see Madame Web holding the spider in a vision. Which suggests she will give them spider power. And their powers were all pretty cool. We only get to see them in the dream.The beginning insinuates they were all in the same train, complete strangers, going to the same place. Supposedly, this place was where they would have been bitten by the spider. But, its never revealed where they were all going. The Evil Spiderman killed them in Web's vision and she saved them.The explanation for Web's power was cool. It's basically the spider sense, but way more potent. As if she did not receive the rest of Spiderman's power but it compensated by making her spider sense 10x more powerful. How do you kill a women who knows how and when it's coming? You don't. She kills you."
ashleighheaton-26131,6,It's really not that bad,"I heard on tiktok that this film was a mess, the worst superhero film ever, not enough action, things of the sort. I genuinely can't fathom what made people hate this film so much, there isn't anything in the film to be majorly offended by. I think there is an expectation for films to be world changing, perspective altering pieces of cinema and I really don't think that is necessary of every film. This was a fairly enjoyable film that I didn't have to figure out or take a deeper meaning from while watching and I was honestly thankful about that. In my opinion this film had the right amount of action while maintaining a story and honestly harked back to the original sony spider films that weren't trying to squeeze in ten million characters from the wider cinematic universe in. This film is genuinely not as bad as people are saying and I'm actually hoping that they make a second film as I would love to see where these characters go next. A part of me also wonders whether this film ""is the worst comic adaptation yet"" because it has a female centred cast, but that's just a thought. I at least enjoyed this film more the Quantumania."
drmaamsudan,7,Not that bad,"Dakota is good but she is not amazing. The movie production is great! The villain wasn't amazing but fine.There are some switches didn't go smoothly but generally it wasn't a bad experience.I looked to the worst movie I've seen recently (Black Adam) found it rated 6 and eh. That's why I'm giving 7 but really it should be 5 ish.Generally if there is another episode I'll go down to the cinema grab a combo and watch it!Do I recommend it? Yes I can and don't hate me if you didn't like it.It's not the amazing poor things or the breath taking Oppenheimer, it's Napoleon like disappointment."
lovelady-31574,9,Best from Marvel in a long time.,"I am a big fan of Dakota Johnson's so maybe I'm prejudiced but I loved this movie. I was emancipated as a teen and had a lot in common with the teenagers Madame Web shepherds in this beginning story. I loved her relationship with her mother and her self. This was so unexpected, as I expected another story where brawn and muscle and cool costumes always win.I hope there are more Madame Web stories to come out.The special effects were great and didn't get in the way of the story. I gave it a nine instead of a ten because the woods didn't look real enough to me. That's my excuse. I never read ten star reviews so I gave it nine. That's the reason."
lashadjackson,7,People are ridiculous: it's a solid film,"Let's just be honest. The reviews are coming in hot from dudes who just don't like women. The movie is solid. The story tracks and it connections are surprisingly smooth. I am not sold on the timeline and how it fits with Sony's spiderverse, but overall. It's not as bad as these people suggest.Cons:
I do have a problem with Dakota Johnson's flat range, but that's on brand for her. Nothing new. As high as the stakes were, she should have been more demanding on screen with added dimensions.Pros:
The villains motivations were rooted in fear and immorality. Simple. Nothing crazy or unobtainable.Very plausible.Adam Scott's portrayal of Uncle Ben Parker is cool. He's funny and young whippersnapper. I've never seen a younger version of the character.All-In-All:
Don't be that ""guy"" who's just hating because it's a women driven movie. It's solid. I recommend it for anyone who's willing to enter with a clear mind with no expectations."
unclemiaproductions,6,S.J deserves another crack at it.,"I tell anyone with ears that if a film has more than 2 writers, it's a recipe for confusion and tragedy. Too many opinions in the pre-production aspect of a film (including studio heads asking for changes) can become overwhelming and creatively stifle the team before the first day of filming even begins. I get it. Studios get in the way, especially for novice directors and writers.As usual, the recent fad is to trash movies that truly aren't that terrible.That being said, this film has it's merits.The score, editing, coloring (ha, yes) were all on point. I streamed it, so I wasn't pissed about the loss of any money.The script is a broken toy that still keeps moving. The lines are generic and gives NOTHING for the actors to find. Whatever happened to OBJECTIVE, TACTIC, NEED, DESIRE, THE HUMAN CONDITION, etc.. We have to be careful because we start losing the meaning of WHY we care with these superhero movies and it all goes out the window.The movie moves at a nice speed. The girls are talented but should've been teenagers (not Sydney dressed up to look like one), allowing us more empathy for Cassie as she (spoiler) ""adopts"" them as her own.Ezekiel is weak casting. Does he have followers or something?The team deserves a 2nd shot. Sequel? Eh. Possibly."
healingtoolbox,9,THIS IS NOT A BRO-MOVIE. Go see The Beekeeper.,"Madama WebTHIS IS NOT A BRO-MOVIE. It's NOT crass, profane, or ugly. If you want a good Bro-Movie, go see The Beekeeper.I address the deluge of negative reviews further below.I liked The Marvels (2024). It's a celebration of healthy girl power, the power of female friendship. Mr. Google says most pages for these search terms are overwhelmingly pre-Covid, pre Ukraine, pre-Gaza. Marvel celebrating girl power in a big way was rare and delightful to me.Madame Web is an ever rarer animal, a celebration of healthy WOMAN POWER, healthy feminine intuition; and, nurturant-protective parenting.Madame Web goes all the way to celebrating healthy psychotherapy, how it can lead to dissolving abandonment issues you thought you had with parents. I dare you to name even one other movie portraying this in a positive light.I hope and pray children growing up in 2024, have role models for these positive qualities.Not incidentally, the script is EXCELLENT, a writerly concoction which drew me in (even better if you avoid trailers for this film). The script is clearly the work of many talented hands on the difficult theme of seeing the future; and, then having the balls to change the future if you dislike what you see. The future-seeing power is introduced with both subtlety and conviction.Contrary to a negative professional review I heard before going, there is no deus ex machina contrivances. Character choices and outcomes all made sense to me (and I'm a writer).ABOUT THOSE NEGATIVE REVIEWS
Based on the negativity of professional reviews towards The Marvels, my guess was Madama Web would get the same treatment. I was not disappointed.How can we understand an outpouring of hostility towards a film dedicated to positive themes and archetypes? If you ask me, here's what I say. It's easy to give lip-service to a positive future for the 99% of people and especially to children. It's easy to say, ""We want nice things; and, we deserve nice things.""However in addition to our wishes for a positive future, there is another force who has authority to test our intentions and good wishes. We can call it the Tester. Some readers of this may now the fledgling discussion among film goes and critics about how the most positive and uplifting movies often attract the most negative reviews--especially from male reviewers. It's like a tug-of-war on the level of the collective choice we are making whether the physical-material future is a dystopia or Nature and child-friendly. Given this tug-of-war I invite you to think for yourself and support those films which even in small ways describe the kind of future you want for yourself and your kids."
john-4399,6,Curious level of unwarranted hatred for this film,"I don't understand why there is such venom hurled at this film. Is it just because there is some kind of malaise with Comic Book Hero / Marvel content at the moment? Sure, it is not the best of its type but it is certainly nowhere near as bad as many have suggested. In my book it is no worse than Morbius and not as banal as The Marvels. According to IMDb box office info, the movie grossed close on $100M (2024) and turned in a small profit - so enough people went to see it. This says to me that it is not as much a ""lemon"" as many would have us believe. While The Marvels was bigger budget, at time of writing, it has still not returned a profit. On the other hand, there is no doubt super hero films seem to be going through a lacklustre period. Having read many of the poor reviews before I saw it, I was expecting to hate it - but I didn't. The 2 hours passed quite painlessly for me and I was sufficiently engrossed to see it through to the conclusion. Dakota Johnson turned in a good performance with the material she had and the supporting cast were quite plausible. It is by no means the best super hero movie I have ever seen and I probably won't ever watch it again but it is not atrocious."
arlosmdina-22054,6,Not a Bang! Pow! Clunk! Superhero movie but a movie nonetheless.,"If you are fed-up with the robotic suit-like saturated visual effects SFX trippy backgrounds superhero movie, you're gonna have a good time here... It's slow pace and it's the very Lady-like (of all ages and backgrounds) of Spiderman! - it makes you believe that Spidermen are meant to be sidekicks.Dakota's character is so great (you're not my problem get-lost sort of attitude).Spoiler Alert!Best part 1: When on duty as a paramedic, she saved a relative of a little boy for which he drew a family picture to thank her. She looked at the young boy and said ""no thank you"" (😂😅😆).Best part 2: Latin Ancient Spider People Tree Tribes, in PERU!!!! (The costumes mama) Jungle couture!Best part 3: it gives you clear glimpses of what's coming on in the Spiderwomen Universe.Best part 4: Madam Web did not show Ancient Martial Art Skills, Super speed or Super strength, but you feel at the end of movie that If Madam Web is around, your ass is safe!"
gabethedinosaur,10,Madam web welcome to 2024,I've been waiting for a madam web movie for years and now it's finally here. Dakota Johnson was the perfect choice for madam web . Emma Robert's playing Peter Parker's mom was so incredible. The teens who will be the new spiderwoman in the spiderverse will travel to all spiderverses i hope they meet more spiders and join forces together and fight a new villain in the multiverse. Madam web she's the key to all the multiverse. She can see what's gonna happen in the next multiverse. I hope she has an appearance in tom hollands Spider-Man 4 and she tells him what he has done and what is gonna happen in the spiderverse.
masterlu-1,6,Movie with potential that missed its marks,"Madame Web had a lot of potential and the possible sequels even more potential (especially a ""stand alone"" sydney sweeney Spidergirl/woman spinoff). But the movie missed its marks. I would have preferred a speed up of the origin story to get to the blind chick future seer leading 3 hot young chicks with spider powers. It was kind of slow because they didnt punch the emotional scenes or foreshadow correctly. Falling off the bridge in the car should have been more courageous and tramautic. There should have been emphasis for her to see that the car WOULD fall if she got in and then more teeter totter warnings as she struggled to save the victim and more personal trauma as she realized she was not going to get out in time but pushing the victim out just in time. Also, when she discovered her mother sacrificed to save her in vitro, thereby realizing she should be grateful rather than lifelong resentful toward her mom, it came across as hollow or forced. Should have been more forshadowing or build up of her resentment beforehand. The action sequences were vague and undefined. It wasn't clear as to what the glowing ""webs"" reaching out to the three girls hanging precariously, were. While her power to predict falling debris is a good one, it needed to be done more actively visual, like she needed to move more conspicuously to maneuver her opponnent. Say, like several big dramatic near misses b4 the final big finish.All in all though, it wasn't a bad movie. It was mildly entertaining and could lead to future successes (altho this one looks to be a dud box office wise)."
d4wn0ff473,6,Missed opportunities but not terrible,"This is not as bad as people say. The people handing out 1 star reviews must have never seen the fantastic four movie from the mid 90s.The story is deliberately disjointed to give the audience a bit of a glimpse into what it feels like to be webb herself. It actually treats you with a little respect in regard to piecing things together, which is frankly more than can be said for the majority of superhero films out there.The character is drab compared to the depth of comic book character and johnson is a little too deadpan in scenes where we would expect more of a reaction.Overall the setup here is good for future movies, and it plays nicely into the Spiderman universe to set the character up for a broader use."
housermichael,8,The beautiful Dakota Johnson,"I have been a fan of Dakota Johnson since I saw her in ""The Social Network"" back in 2010. Since then I have liked her in films like ""Black Mass"", ""How to be Single"" and ""A Bigger Splash"". And of course she was great in ""Fifty Shades of Gray"" and it's sequels.Now she stars in the new superhero movie ""Madame Webb"" and I liked it a lot. Also starring Sidney Sweeney, Isabela Merced, and Celeste O'Connor as the three young women she meets and protects from danger. Also with Adam Scott and Emma Roberts.The story is about how Dakota Johnson's character, Cassie Webb, discovers her ability to see into the future.I found the movie to be very entertaining and enjoyable. It is well made with good editing and good cinematography from Maura Fiore who did ""Avatar"". A good time at the movies."
austingadsden,10,Reviews by Critics and Audience Alike Reveal How Lost We've Become,"Madame Web offers an original take on superhero movies that strays from the same tired recipe we've all seen a million times: shoot, punch, joke and punch some more. The female protagonists make you like them and care, and the origin story and superhero ability of Cassie is refreshingly different, with endless possibilities for the future. It seems that critics and audience alike are unable to see beyond their pre-conditioned prejudices of what a good superhero movie should be, and said prejudice limits their mental capacity and artistic imagination to perceive the power of the mind's potential over stupid's jet-lagged physicality. This is, ironically, the actual point of the plot and the downfall of the villain, whom reviewers so adamantly criticize as bland, not realizing they are one in the same. Open your mind. See the web. And if you can't see it, think more deeply before speaking, or at least ask somebody who hasn't been plucked from the masses."
bmasteller,10,Love this,"I love this movie. I've been waiting for this movie for a long time. I love Dakota Johnson, I think she does a wonderful job in this movie. The fact that she can see the future and hopefully change it is something the Marvel cinematic universe needs. I really hope they make a sequel to this. They have to let the story develop just like they did the other stories in the marvel universe . I don't understand why marvel would do that make a movie and then put everything into it and then not continue the storyline. You have to give it a chance. Please make the sequel to this movie. I would definitely go see it in the theater. Maybe they need to put some more into advertisement."
minisue,8,Great Movie!,"I really enjoyed this movie. I really hate critics! A move that receives a high rating sucks and a movie that receives a low rating is great! Don't listen to the critics, make up your own mind. This is not your typical Marvel movie and not part of the Spider-verse. Moviegoers were warned that it is a stand alone movie that tells the story of how Madame Web became to be. I enjoyed the comedy and partnership between Dakota and Adam. The protective nature that Dakota has for the girls really shows the beginning of her superhero nature. To protect three girls that she has never met because she saw they were going to be hurt, how is that not a superhero. Thank You for telling the story!"
beechenp,8,Ya'll being too harsh,"I had a fun time watching this in theaters. The characters were fun, the actors were fun...the dialogue was a bit cheesy. But, come on, it is a super hero movie it doesn't have to be ground breaking. I also want to see what happens next with the characters.Get a grip, people hating on it the morning it is released. Ya'll too much. Also why do I need so many characters now to write a review. I was excited to see Emma Robert's in it, I didn't know she would be. Do you think Ben was played by Adam Scott because of Parks of Recs? He's cool, I like him. Is that enough characters already geeze. Fun film, haters relax. Bye."
claybyderek,10,"Had a blast on this one, ignore the bad reviews","3/10 guys really? I've seen way worse movies with higher score. The hate this movie gets is just vile, really shows that it's truly targeted by male comic lovers.The plot is good, at the beginning it makes you feel like it isn't a supper hero movie. It's fun, the characters have good chemistry, Emma robberts it's on it, the only thing I'm a bit sad over was the fact that I wanted to see the three girls in their full powers era. I guess if people actually give it a try we might get to see it.In truth tired of all these bias reviews, in the 2000s we would kill for a movie this good. I really want to ask those 1* reviewers if they really haven't seen worse than this? Because clearly they are lying, I could give the eternals a low score but even 1* is low. I don't think I've seen a 1* movie ever.Also what is up with the Sony haters? Really you guys defending Disney Marvel? Like thor3, doctor strange 2 and all those Disney + shows didn't exist? Sorry but Sony is doing the only decent supper heroes movies right now.Give it try, especially if you want to watch something fun. I had a blast and so did the whole audience."
jmhjr7,8,"Entertaining, effects are well done, doesn't take itself too seriously","Aspects of this movie are rough around the edges: some voice overdubbing is noticeable, the script occasionally felt clunky, a few expositional scenes could have been condensed. But there were redeeming qualities: The soundtrack matched the early 2000s time period. The sound effects were loud and crisp. The visuals were impressive and didn't rely on milky CGI green-screen backgrounds that other movies in this genre cling to. As a movie-goer, will you leave the theater deeply moved by Madame Web, thirsting to watch it again tomorrow? Probably not. But I don't think you'll remember it as the ""worst movie ever made"" as some reviews have done. It reminded me of superhero movies like the Toby Maguire Spiderman films, before the idea of a branded cinematic universe. I think most people will see Madam Web later when it's released on streaming platforms and will be pleasantly surprised. Wow, the movie that got a terrible review from the majority of online critics is actually fun and easy to watch and I didn't need to watch a thousand prequels to get it!"
nikiteodorov,10,Great Spider-Man movie!!!,"The movie is juste great for Spider-man fans. There is enough Easter eggs from the Spidey's lore. I don't get the negative reviews. I'm wondering if the people even know who is Madame Web and what are her abilities... It's good origin story with some original elements. Hope she and the spider girls appear in the future projects. Love it!!! All actors are really great and the 2000s vibe is amazing. There is enough references that can be used as origins story, also for some of the Spider-man movies. Hope they build even more the Spidey's universe with this characters. Can't wait to see what Marvel and Sony are preparing for the future!"
xscrubby,10,It's an Origin Story For MADAME WEB!,"Went to check this out with the kiddos. They had early release from school so we caught it at lunch on opening day. An unbiased opinion of 8 year old Daughter ""Daddy i loved it! It was so cool!"". 11 year old Son ""it was okay. The cgi was pretty generic. The story was cool.""Well in my honest opinion the movie was pretty neat. It is an Origin Story for MADAME WEB only. The story shows where she came from, who she was, how she became who she will be and why. The other girls are just along for the ride but damn it you WANT to know more about them too!! Why do I wanna know more!? Because I collected and own all those comic books too! 😁 They were all fun interesting spider person series!! And the actors/characters were likeable!So I will give this movie a solid 7.0 on the comic book movie scale. I put 10 because the people who put 1 are not properly rating it and probably didn't even watch it. I wanted more! I hope we get more! There is a lot of hints to different tie ins from another spider character but dang it only true believers will see. 😁 form your own opinion and check it out for yourself If you are an avid movie theatre person.Dont trust online reviews. People who say ""it was All over the place"" for some reason they are people who can not follow a story. The storyline flowed and made sense. This is how we get the Madame Web for our spider-verse!"
cgearheart,10,Hilarious and Mind Meltingly Stupid,"I this might be the first time I've seen a movie in theaters that was so unintentionally hilarious that it had turned the entire audience into a relative cult film audience. Everyone was laughing hysterically and making audible jokes and jabs at various points of the movie. There may have even been some very ironic cheering during the movie but there was undoubtedly a lot of uncontrollable fits of manic, desperate laughter due to how horrifically made it was. I saw it with my family on my birthday and our heads hurt badly from the horrible editing and the lack of oxygen we were receiving since we were laughing so hard. My dad was cringing at the entire movie as if he was watching a very awkward person trying to flirt for 2 hours. Madame Web is unironically one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my life."
Luce1417,10,"Wow the reviews are ridiculous, is this another hating a women superhero movie?","Honestly the movie isn't a 10/10 but giving it so it can even out the bad reviews.It's a solid 7/10. Went to watch this with no expectations, i saw the bad reviews but still wanted to see it. I gotta say this new trend of hating films about women superheroes is becoming very evident. Saw it with the Marvels.The plot is pretty solid, the first part makes you think it's not a supper hero movie. It reminded me of final destination a bit. I think it was a good introduction story, people are complaining that she was a paramedic before. She had to have a life before becoming madame web. It remind me of the 2000s supper hero movies where there wasent that much crazy CG and it had a good story.I felt for the characters, i liked the characters. The teather that i went to had tons of families and they all seem to be enjoying it. The chemistry of the four girls was good. The acting of Dakota is a bit off, she isn't the best actress but she was fine. The other girls were fine, typical teenagers, i had no issue with their acting.Compared to what we have been getting from Marvel this one is pretty good, i wasn't bored, perhaps a bigger climax for the end but it was great not seeing crazy CG with flying humans not getting hurt, i thought the final sequence was pretty believable. If you want to have fun and see an okay film that won't drain the life out of you go watch this one.The kids at the theater loved it, my kids loved it. Not everything needs to be a Nolan depressing movie. These type of reviews is the reason why we don't get anything fun anymore. Also all these reviews seem to be very men based . Also how did it get so many bad reviews before actually being in theaters?"
mark-3140,10,"Ok, not 10, but I need to get your attention.","What is the matter with people who can't follow a clearly laid out storyline!The villain kills her pregnant mum, but she delivered by legendary 'spider people'.She is then seen as a paramedic, driving 'skilfully'. She has a near death experience and starts to get Deja view experiences.Bad guy has visions of his death at the hands of 3 spider women and plots killing them first.She prevents him, by having anticipating visions.She has to return to where her mother was killed and the spider people show her her past and future.Also revealed is Mme Web should have a debilitating disease, so being able to walk and see is a super power, but her spider sense is phenomenal and she creates the 3 spider women.A really good movie if you want a good story!"
scousekid69,8,"So good, I watched it twice!","Admittedly, the second time was at the IMAX. What's with all the bad reviews? I thought it was great!Dakota is just so good to watch: she's funny, she's beautiful, and she knows how to drive an ambulance! I knew nothing about Madame Webb, apart from the trailer, before I went in, and whilst I would have liked to have known more about the origins and about the bad guy - such as how did he get so rich? - the most annoying thing in the whole movie was how they were describing a spiderman without actually using the word ""spiderman!"" like you and I would (I know, copyright). Well that and seeing Pepsi so blatantly being advertised.Back to the movie: action-packed without overdoing it, lots of one liners to make you smile, and if your boyfriend is there just to see Sydney Sweeney he will be disappointed to say the least - she's almost unrecognisable!Everybody, go see Madame Webb a second time, but in IMAX or 4DX, you might just enjoy it like I did!"
pixrox1,8,Batman had his Bat Woman.,"The Six Billion Dollar Man had his 500 million buck distaff counterpart. Tarzan had Jane. As MADAME WEB battles her Spider Man, it's pretty hard to decide who to root for. This film really keeps its viewers guessing. Spider Man seems to have the vast majority of the cool moves, but he's hooked on Coca Cola, so naturally you expect that Pepsi eventually will do him in when push comes to shove. Most often the Good Guys have the best technology, and in this arena Spider Man towers head and shoulders above MADAME WEB. On the other hand, the female arachnid tools around with a gang of wayward juvenile delinquents, calling in her taxpayer-funded colleagues to be wiped out while attempting rescues from conflagrations which she herself initiates. Beware the kiss of the Spider Woman."
icloyd,10,Dakota Johnson is fit to be the Titular Character,"It seems that too many are envious about Dakota Johnson... Of course she is fit to be the titular character. Madame Web is a great movie, me and friends who watched the movie enjoyed it...
The movie is not boring, maybe those people who rated 1 in this movie didn't understand the movie at all. We love the casting and Dakota Johnson is stunning. She nailed her role and she was awesome...
We are rooting for a part two and Of course we want to see Dakota again as the leading role. We are the young people and our voices should be heard..
If all the young people will do the reviews, the rating is high..."
vgamerdc,10,Howard Hawks would be proud; a perfect satire; a future cult-classic,"This has been the greatest cinematic experience I have ever witnessed. I've seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in 70mm at the Aero, Lawrence of Arabia Roadshow Edition in 70mm, Hateful Eight, Oppenheimer, all of these cinematic masterpieces in 70mm, but none of them impacted me on an emotional level like Madame Web has. Everything in this movie is 100% intentional and the fact that people don't realize that astounds me. In this review I hope to share my experience for those to understand why this is a 10/10 satirical reflection on the state of superhero movies today, and how/why this made it an actual masterpiece better than Barbie.Firstly, I saw it at the AMC, and I was thrilled the complete, full version of Nicole Kidman's introduction played. I always clap out loud. And as I made up 1/3 of the entire audience, I was able to clap and hoot as loud as I wanted. Second, I'm 99% positive the protectionist receive a note from Sony to mess up the projector, giving it a Grindhouse feel. The whites were ever so slightly red (you can see this during the MPAA green screen whim the trailers play) AND the projector was a little shaky! This added to the effect that I was watching something on film and added a B movie effect Tarantino fans will love. There is no way this is accidental given everything in this film.I think Sony's greatest takeaway from Morbius was how popular the movie became because it was bad. So their idea: make something so bad it's good. This is 100% intentional and they succeeded in parodying themselves.1. It takes itself seriously but is aware that it is taking itself seriously. All of these superhero movies today are too darn serious. These are spider women! This satire is set up immediately with the dialogue being on the nose, the acting purposefully being both bland and over the top but ""subtle,"" and the insane TikTok-ification of the camera. There is no consistency anywhere. The fake zooms in the beginning of the movie are clear evidence that it was on purpose because that's what is silly. The director is completely aware of this and does a fantastic job.2. It takes place in 2003! Daredevil was released that year, Catwoman was being filmed, and Spider-Man 2 hadn't even been released yet. Putting it in this year with this style is meant to evoke the atmosphere of those movies. They have a level of cheese to them that we can enjoy today.3. The antagonist: he is literally just a dude who is afraid women are going to kill him. They don't pose any actual threat. He gets up and starts fighting them because he is afraid. This is a reflection of the current socio-political climate today, especially in regards to resistance to female superheroes. YES, WE ALL KNOW ""it's not the women, it's bad writing."" To prove that point, there are no derogatory comments toward men in this entire movie. It follows the same formula as so many other superhero movies where they don't become the Titular Hero until the very end of the movie. While many people wanted to see a movie about Madam Web, this is a template origin story. It's not trying to be better than male superhero movies. It's doing the exact same thing, and that's the point. The conversation can now shift to the matter of: quality of writing. But the producers know what is selling and intend to milk it as long as possible. This film died a hero, like Dakota Johnson for 50 Shades, so her future can live a better life. Or, to quote Barbie, ""We mothers stand still so our daughters can look back and see how far they've come.""4. The cast: Dakota Johnson, leading lady of 50 Shades of Grey, is THE WOMAN FOR THE JOB. She's done a notoriously bad movie before and she can do it again. She is a symbol of hope for the up and coming starlets of the movie: both in her character and IRL. Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced are all young starlets that are ""in"" with modern audiences. But how long will this last? Historically, and still today, the Hollywood system brings in young women-sorry, Celeste, I know your pronouns are they/them-exploiting their youth and good looks, only to not care about them after, oh, 25 (which is the cutoff age for Leonardo Dicpario's girlfriends). Yes, Sydney Sweeney is 26, but she plays a high schooler in Euphoria. Celeste O'Connor looks very young, and Isabela Merced was Dora! I'm glad the antagonist wasn't a woman trying to find the spider equivalent of the fountain of youth, because then the message is more on the nose and less enjoyable than the subtlety of this villain. The point I'm trying to make is: Dakota Johnson is a role model via character and as an actress for these young women. Their characters are completely empty and archetypes because that is what the industry has done to them in the past and present. The film ends with the quote, which is a VOICEOVER btw, ""The best part about the future? It hasn't happened yet.""
......^ this is driven further with the fact that Madame Web has the power of foresight. The original draft was some terminator thing. Yeah, stopping the future from happening?! Exactly! This movie perpetuates everything the previous superhero movies have done in order to end with you saying: I hope they stop making these bad movies. It is genius because it doesn't state this directly like Deadpool!5. Characters are wardrobe: in addition to the diverse group of assigned-at-birth-females, the film further reflects society by having the up and coming starlets not be developed at all. They are literally just themselves. All of them are, in the future, spider women. By not developing them now, the positive point is: there is a Madame Web in all of us. But it's also an intentional reflection on how women are not developed in these movies: they are there for plot and appearance. Everyone accept for Johnson shows some sort of skin that is meant to please the (young) male viewers. They are quite aware of the power their exposed epidermis has on the male mind, as well as the 2003 representation of women. Celeste and Isabel bare mid-drift and Sydney is in an obvious Britney Spears school outfit, with stockings, baring her thighs. This is literal male gaze but it is done intentionally by a female director and her female/non-binary leading cast because it's a reflection. The theme of the movie is changing the future, so we have to acknowledge the past and present that will be changed. The male antagonist is afraid of this. And the corporate sponsorship product placement shows that democracy is indeed still alive and thriving because follow the money. If you want better movies, prove it with your wallets. I do want a Madame Web 2, but it's gotta be the movie we deserve, not the one we needed right now. Which, actually, this movie was BOTH. But you know what I mean. I don't think there will be a Madame Web 2, and I'm okay with that because it's the idea enough that builds the web of the future.Also, Johnson's character being dismissive of a drawing of a kid despite her being a literal medical agent who protects and serves. It's bad and on purpose. So many of these characters have to ""overcome their internal flaw"" which is usually being a dick of some sort. It's the Christmas movie cliches of a parent working too much and not spending time with what matters: Family (as demonstrated in fast and furious 3-7). And Sydney Sweeney's character is randomly introduced by literally stating, ""Oh, and I'm his step sister by the way,"" then walks off. This is not an accident!Oh, and let's not forget Emma freaking Roberts as the sister of Ben Parker! I can't say the mom of P**** Parker because ooooooo wHo CoUlD iT bE?!?! It's perfect. And her name being Mary, which is one letter shy of May, which made me incredibly confused of the timeline.6. All of the little nuances in the film. The Optimus Prime 18 wheeler randomly in the background outside of the diner. ""What's Up"" by Four Non Blondes-which everyone in my generations knows as the He-Man ""HEYYEYAAEYAAAEYAEYAA"" song is in the background, not the forefront. DREAMS BY THE CRANBERRIES AS THE END CREDITS! As any film student and lover of A24 films knows, that song was in the Wong Kar-Wai film Chungking Express. This is 100% intentional and not an accident. This is an 80 million dollar production. Everything on screen is intentional. Such as that CPR scene, which not only is an obvious foreshadowing added in hindsight, but... kinda a piece of fan service? It's a random scene for these women to put their hands and elbows close together in front of their chest while bending over. Yet they're all covered, thus indicating the stupidity of the camera's gaze and the scene as a whole. AND the whole twist on ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Genius. Again, another example that they are self aware and making fun of the entire genre as a whole. It's amazing.7. The story: Howard Hawks would be proud. His philosophy is that the audience does not care about the plot so long as they are entertained; this movie, in doing all of the tropes which has come before it, and by not taking itself seriously through the direction taking itself seriously but only just so, proves his point. These movies are dumb and they know it. Theh have the classic Spider-Man voiceover! Completely unnecessary to the story and is there only to talk to the audience. You have not been tricked; you have been enlightened!Madame Web is a cinematic masterpiece. It is a perfect image reflection on society today and the state of superhero movies. The fact that everyone is taking this movie seriously proves its own point. I will be buying this on 4K UHD when it comes out. I will also use whatever remaining AMC A List tickets I have left each week to go toward this masterpiece. Thank you SJ Clarkson, Dakota Johnson, Celeste, Isabela, Sydney, and the executives at Sony for your daring and bold contribution to cinema."
italiacaca,8,Enjoyed and fresh,"Not sure why the hate....... it was nowhere near as bad as all the reviews. Go in it with an open mind and decide on your own. Acting was ok, not a Dakota Johnson fan, but wasn't horrible. I felt the story was understandable. If you follow comics it was totally ok, if you don't I guess I could understand the bad reviews. ( I did hate the diner scene) so wouldn't be allowed... only thing I could say is character building could be better. All in all give it a chance, make your own view on it I read all the hate and was wondering why. I watched and felt like I was not cheated like most people...."
kateycq,9,A lot better than I thought.,"A lot of people hate this film and I really don't see why. The cinematography was one of the best from a marvel movie and the actress where casted very well. The acting was great, the story was different but amazing. People hate this movie almost for no reason. The ending and how this ties with the actual Peter Parker/ Spider-Man was really cool. I hate how people are shaming movies like this when they actually aren't bad. I expected to go into the theater confused and not get anything good because of the reviews but it explained everything very well. In the beginning of the movie it was confusing but that was the point of it and by the end of the movie everything was answered and it left me in shock. People have to really think about the movie and how it ties with all the other hero's in marvel. It makes the movie 10x better."
maxepple,10,A unconventional movie for a unique hero,"This movie is not nearly as terrible as critics and other reviewers are making it out to seem. It's more of an 8 out of 10 but I had to give it a 10 to balance out the sexist 1 star reviews. There definitely are parts of the movie that could have been polished more but overall people are being way too harsh on this movie. The dark and gritty tone gives a unique perspective to a superhero with very unconventional powers. It was nice to see someone who doesn't have super strength, or isn't way to OP'd. Go into this movie expecting more of a thriller and less of a superhero movie and you will be pleasantly surprised in my opinion. The movie speaks on sisterhood and the power of persistence. It also is great for any fan of the Spider-Man movies with some fun Easter eggs hidden along the way."
Goodgirl0003,10,It's not a bad film! It's just for Madame Web fans,"Why so much hate? This movies is not that bad. The film kept me entertained from start to finish and that's what movies are supposed to do. This is the story of Madame Web, what else do people want to see on the big screen? The creators have to stay faithful to the story of the comic book character.Film has a couple of good messages but won't mention them don't want to give out any spoilers and the action sequences are good. People are way to picky and critiquing about the special effects.The acting might not be Oscar worthy but its decent. People complaining about films that are predictable, it's not always about know what the end result but how a character faces the challenges along the way and achieves the goal. It's about the journey along the way.What people don't seem to want to understand is that Comic Book characters and its stories are one thing in a book and another thing in a film, they are short stories illustrated in a book and not a literature book. Therefore are very limited content to work with in terms of translating them to the big screen.Comic Book films have to be like the Comic Book. I've seen worst movies. Sorry but ""Thor Love and Thunder' was terrible and has a 6.2 stars... why? Because women have a crush on the protagonist and men want to look like him. That's ridiculous!I gave this film a 10 just to balance out the extremely negative reviews, my honest grade is a 7.5/10."
nathpeix,8,"Not your typical Marvel movie, very enjoyable and visually stunning","This is the story of Madame Web, a character that I didn't get to see on screen often, except in the 1990's Spiderman animate tv series.The movie is about her quest to save 3 teenage girls that don't know each other from a superhuman killer.What makes this movie special is that, even though being a Marvel branded character, it doesn't follow the exact same pattern as every other marvel movie, it doesn't have the same silly humour and doesn't try so much to appeal to children.This super hero movie is visually stunning. The aesthetics are great and the visual effects are almsot as invisible as they seem to be absent from the movie.The characters are very likeable. They are not the stereotypes we see in other SH movies.The biggest drawbacks of this movie is the villain : he did bad things in the past and he will stop at nothing to reach his goal. But we don't know what his goal is and what is he doing. We basically know nothing about him except that he is a threat.Also, his fight scenes are pure nonsense : when fighting secondary characters, he gets rid of them in a split second, but when facing the main characters, he's like a video game villains that gives as many opportunity as possible to the player in order to let him win.That's a bit disappointing.HOWEVER, I wouldn't call this one a super hero action movie. It's more a storytelling super hero movie. And that one is kind of good. Except from what happens at the end in the water. That sucked."
rileejeanmartin-42192,9,Looking camp right in the eye,"This is the best comedy movie I have ever seen. I fear the haters just do not know true cinema. Some of my favorite quotes:
""How would you know if you can climb a wall if you've never tried"" (said in a completely serious tone)
""The girls were never your future, I was"" (the constant zooming in and out in this movie really enhanced this line)
""When you take on the responsibility, great power will come"" (yes, Uncle Ben is in this movie and no, he does not say this line; a magical spider-person in Peru does)
Every line evil Spider-Man says, with a wooden voice dubbed over a mouth that does not move to match them."
Unapace,9,This is a brave female-themed superhero movie!,"Hopefully, more people will let go of cynicism and prejudices.Yesterday, I watched this movie in a cinema in Italy, and to be honest, seeing the online comments about this movie while waiting to buy tickets almost made me instantly regret it. With a nervous heart, I sat down and started watching, until the song ""Dreams"" played at the end, I wanted to say a few fair words about this movie. After all, most of the mainstream movie critics are not industry insiders, but our love for movies led us to spend two hours in this way. If your aesthetic for superhero movies still revolves around fights, scenes, cinematography, whether the female lead is attractive, whether the male lead is muscular, and whether the storyline is highly stimulating, I really hope you give this movie a chance, because the aforementioned comments can be made by anyone with a mouth and hands. However, how many people really pay attention to the strong female power and emotional growth in this movie, as well as the issue of repairing the protagonist's original family? Spiders have always been very symbolic creatures, and at the end when the female protagonist's web spreads out, I'm reminded of the work of the French artist Louise Bourgeois. I'll just say this much."
nehatwitter,10,An enjoyable movie!! Dakota was amazing,"I really don't understand why people are being so negative. I watched the movie and i wasn't bored for even a second. It's one of the best movies in recent times. Every character makes sense with eachother and i loved dakota as casey web!!! One of the best things about the movie. The cinematic side, the scenes, the way the movie moves forward....all of it was definitely enjoyable. You should watch it and test your own opinion. Be neutral and don't let the reviews influence you. Watch it and create your own opinion. It deserves a try and i will be definitely watch it again. I hope you will to :))"
kiomyencarnacion,10,I love the movie!,"The story started it was amazing because it explains more how much she became madam web. I also loved the fact she protected 3 teens before they were adults that's alot for one person especially if another person is trying to kill them however at the last battle I do wish a little bit she unleashed more of her powers or the teens unlock their powers and helped her. And I just wished it showed a little more of how they grew with powers and defeat the enemy more together but i know it needed to happen the way it did for her eyes and more. And I would love to see them in action with them fighting. And I loved every minute of it I know people may hate but I loved this movie there is lots funny moments, little bit sadness (mother part) and parts that had me thinking and I know in the 2nd movie if they come with one because people fail to see that's how a 1st hero movie starts! But I know very well that the 2nd movie will be good and I hope they come out with a 2nd one."
dsuda-73903,8,Fun ride with Madame Web!,"Wow people were harsh on this movie. I've seen all of the Spider-Man movies and enjoy both Marvel & DC and thought this was fun adventure too!Backstory shows are always fun and this was no different. None of the superhero movies have Oscar level acting yet I though this was good and definitely up to parDakotah pulls us through the odd discovery of her powers and explains how everything fits together.I thought all of the special effects were appropriate, didn't look too plastic. I enjoyed the one liners along the way to get a grin as well.Ignore the nay-sayers, this was a fun ride into a new/original story! Enjoy!"
surekhasrushti,9,I just loved watching it .,"Nice movie with suspense, action & thriller also cinematography was excellence 👍🏻
Actress choice was just perfect for the role.I like the graphics and suspense about her past .And it is directed & shooted very well .Me and my daughter just had fun watching it curiously.It's good movie for young generation girls to understand and to be courageous and self dependant for their own safety .And I like the leading role actress , she is just perfect for this movie role.Story also was very good we liked it.Don't know why the ratings are lower for such a fantastic 🎥 movie.I rate 9 for this movie."
michaelkold,9,It's amazing!,"I have seen a lot of Marvel film. Most of them are the same: One hero (or more) fighting a lot of villiants. There is a lot of fighting, a last fight with the super villiant and then it all ends with a happy ending.This movie is SO different. I like the story, the plot, the twist of her clairvoyant powers and the way it is told. Combined with great characters and amazing effects. This is the best ""superhero"" movie I have seen in 10 years. I just love it, and I would love to see more movies with Madam Web and the rest of her spider crew. No. I'm not at superhero nerd, but I lknow a good movie, when I seet it <3."
giovannipezzino,10,Unbridled masterpiece,"The only way to describe this movie is an insult to what it means to truly experience such a zeitgeist of the millennium. What I can proudly say is that IT IS A MOVIE OF ALL TIME!For anyone and no one, a classic that will remain deep in people's cherished memories for all their lives, possibly being the very last thing on many minds before death. This is what important art is, deathless, forever, immortal, such paragon piece of contemporary history of everyone, of humans, and spiders, and human-spiders, as well as spider-humans. This will always have a place in what true cinema truly stands for. A tale for all ages and webs. The directors directed, the actors acted, the plot plotted, the lines were lined, the FX FXed, the scripted scripted! The lines (of cocaine) were clearly snorted too, let us not forget this does not come as easy as it may sound, but this may have just managed to bring down an whole industry , no easy feat, and change cinema forever.BRAVO!I cannot wait for what the future of the MWCU (Madame Web Cinematic Universe) will bring. Perhaps a connected sequel with the only movie of comparabe caliber, the only possible solution that comes to mind is Morbius! That would be something to behold.Let me end this humble review with the iconic line ""It's webbing time!!!""."
kloyd_yu,10,Too many Bashers here. This movie is great.,"Those who put 1 score here are ignorant and they don't know how to appreciate a good movie. I watched this film together with my 7 friends and we all loved it. Very entertaining and Dakota's performance was utterly awesome - she gave justice to her role. It was an amazing movie overall. Great script, great direction, great performances and great castings. Dakota is Brilliant. I just don't know why some people are very ignorant and they don't know the significance of this film. People don't know how to appreciate a great movie. Guys, go to the cinema and watch this movie please. You won't regret."
marleneandrade-55848,10,Great movie and very interesting characters,"After fearing the bad reviews me and my boyfriend still decided to give this a go, as he's a huge Marvel fan and we liked the trailer. We really enjoyed the movie: it's interesting, different and refreshing. The plot is very cool and I liked the concept of a superhero not focused on physical skills but more mental (a sort of Professor Xavier). I don't understand the bad reviews at all. I must say I really like Dakota, she has a je ne sais quois, something about her really makes her performances engaging. It was also nice to see a movie set in 2003, brought me back to my teenage years. I recommend this movie!"
sisterlybonds,10,This movies was way better then any of these reviews would suggest,"My family and I loved this movie and quite enjoyed the all female representation that it provides, every few seconds we would look at each other in shock from these plot twists and cool new story lines. I would one hundred percent recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who would listen the plot is good and easy to follow and it's a great family friendly universe to explore wish I could watch it for the first time again just to feel this wonderful environment come to life again. It is a 10/10 and anyone who say different is sexist and doesn't like to she female superheroes be anything other then eye candy."
penarudy,10,I took the risk and I loved it.,"This movie got bad reviews but I don't always list to reviews so I took the risk anyways and I loved it. It had comedy, action and drama. The only thing I didn't like was the dinner scene when Dakota Johnson's character decides to go back, it make any sense!! The rest of the movie was good. I was expecting something more at the end but the way it ended was good enough for me. If you're looking for a good actor movie then trust me you'll love this one and I'm not afraid of saying that when people are just trashing this movie. I'm saying this from what I thought about it and I'm planning on buying it as soon as it hits digital.."
vkeshri-75822,10,Fantastic movie,"After seeing the rating, I though i made a mistake of buying ticket to watch this movie, but believe me it's very good movie. I would give 10 out of 10. Go and watch the movie hope you will like it.Story of the movie is very different and its very different super hero movie. Cast and the character of the movie is good. From my point of view I liked it and my family too like it. Its my advice go and watch before come to the conclusion.I don't know why people start comparing with other super hero, here the concept of the super hero is different. This is my honest review and will adivce you to watch it once."
jobaby-04710,10,Not that bad!,"To give people negative reviews based on their anger towards Sony and how Spider-Man should be presented is very unfair and unfair to the hardworking film production team and actor.The movie itself wasn't that bad, I thought it gave me good entertainment for very little money, maybe I was deceived because the heroine was so beautiful.It is recommended that you do not have any expectations or ideas about how the plot should be played before watching the movie, otherwise you will really lose a lot of fun!No matter what company buys Marvel, we should all enjoy the fun that movies bring us and the possibilities for more development of movies, and relax."
tristanmaenhaut,10,Trailer didn't do the movie justice.,"The trailer didn't do the movie justice at all.Excellent action scenes and the villain fitted wel into the story and didn't look as goofy as in the trailer, where the suit just looked kinda odd and more fan-made.One annoying point were the acting scenes where the villain just wasn't in suit and his voice.To sum it all, the movie is definitely a worthy addition to the SSU and your money. So yes rest assured, this means it's well over the level of the Morbius movies and nothing like it.Don't let the negative critics make you sceptical to go watch this movie, it's an exciting movie with.I really hope we get to see more of Madam Web in future projects because it deserves to :)"
leroyhenzen,10,Enjoyed it very much!,"I actually liked Madame Web very much. From the very beginning the main character got me interested in her origin story. I loved how the development of her powers was slowly build up and I really liked the connection with her past and that of her mother. I actually loved it that it isn't a typical superhero movie with one action scene after the other, but that it focuses more on storytelling. The only thing I didn't like were the 3 girls. Their origin stories weren't worked out which made them feel like extra and a bit unnecessary. I loved all the connections with Spider-Man and would have loved to see more of that in upcoming movies."
professordj,10,Not the Old Lady we expected...so what!,"The problem is NOT with this movie, which was very good as movies go by the way. The problem is with an audience spoiled on Marvel Movie success. You have to understand that a successful movie must play up to a crescendo, a climax AND CANNOT START OUT AS ONE! In truth, there were conceptual errors made not the least of which was to go too lightly on the dynamic between the villain and the heroes: we needed more actual pain, stress, and danger between combatants. The more at stake, the more key losses, the more we'd care. Mind you, this story was good, but it didn't BLEED, NO GRIEF! No loss! No tears ... At least not yet!"
jeremymathewmoss-878-986982,10,Offset the Crisis and here's why,"Give this movie a chance it might surprise you.Why are critics so critical about this film, it has all the elements that they're looking for especially pertaining to the heros journey. The heroin is developed well and you care about her. The other three are your atypical teenagers and dang are they annoying. The plot is well written and pulls from the widely varied and rich Spider-Man universe, thus linking; if only subtley, the other movies in the spider-verse. Frankly I believe the fact that the leads being female have driven the crisis to troll this film, and troll it they are. Much of what they say is slanderous and formulated to cause controversy and misdirection, and that sells views and ads."
witchsbrew82,10,Embracing the Unapologetic Charm of a Cult Classic,"In a world where superhero films dominating the box office is almost a relic of the past, there's something refreshingly unique about the Madame Web. Despite receiving its fair share of criticism online from manchildren and bandwagon jumpers, this film stands as a testament to embracing the unconventional and reveling in its own absurdity. Do people forget what these films are supposed to be? While some may dismiss it as one of the worst films of all time, to do so is to miss the point entirely.First and foremost, Madame Web is a film that knows exactly what it is. It's not striving to be a serious, Oscar-worthy masterpiece; instead, it unapologetically embraces its own campiness and eccentricity. From its over-the-top characters to its delightfully absurd motivation for the villain, every aspect of the film exudes a sense of self-awareness and playfulness (really brought home by Dakota Johnson's bored yet sultry delivery). And in a cinematic landscape often dominated by formulaic blockbusters, this willingness to break the mold and take risks within the limited IP should be celebrated, not ridiculed.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its casting, particularly Dakota Johnson's portrayal of the titular character. Johnson fully commits to the film's offbeat tone, delivering a performance that perfectly matches its quirky sensibility. As Madame Web, she exudes a captivating blend of wit, charm, and eccentricity, commanding every scene she's in with her magnetic presence. It's a testament to Johnson's versatility as an actress that she's able to effortlessly transition from more mainstream fare to the delightfully off-kilter world of Madame Web. The baby shower scene got one of the biggest belly laughs of any film I've seen in theatres in a long time.Furthermore, the film's visual style and aesthetic are nothing short of mesmerizing. From its vibrant color palette to its imaginative set design, every frame of Madame Web is a visual feast for the eyes. I'm not familiar with the directors other work, and sad that based on the reaction to this there won't be much more to come.But perhaps the most important thing to remember about Madame Web is that it's a film meant to be enjoyed on its own terms. Yes, it may not adhere to the traditional conventions of the modern superhero genre that the MCU has dictated and made into a disgusting formula, but that's precisely what makes it so special. In a world oversaturated with cookie-cutter superhero films, Madame Web dares to be different, offering audiences a breath of fresh air in an otherwise stagnant landscape.Of course, no film is without its flaws, and Madame Web certainly has its fair share. Some may argue that its plot is convoluted or that its humor falls flat at times. For me the worst part is the ADR of the villain - makes for some nasty unintended comedy. However, these perceived shortcomings pale in comparison to the sheer joy and entertainment value that the film provides. At its core, Madame Web is a celebration of the power of imagination and the joy of storytelling, and in that regard, it more than succeeds.Madame Web may not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those willing to embrace its idiosyncrasies, it offers a wildly entertaining and endlessly enjoyable cinematic experience. It's a film that knows exactly what it is and isn't afraid to own it, and in an age of conformity and mediocrity, that's something to be celebrated. So let the internet scoff and deride all they want; true fans of cinema know that Madame Web is a cult classic in the making, destined to be cherished for years to come."
mrfatman-52915,8,Pretty good,"Finally a film from Marvel that is not just about explosions or almost a comedy, but has a storyline. Even though the storyline is different than in the comics, they did a great job. The film was not predictable, even though the main character could see into the future.The biggest criticism of this film will be the gut feeling that the protagonists are almost exclusively women. Anyone who is not bothered by that will see a nice, not super good, but nice film. That mainly had to do with the acting. I certainly wouldn't call it bad, but not world class.Furthermore, I'm very curious to see how this will find a place in the Spider-Verse with the introduction of three future characters."
azizkhujakk,10,A Bold Leap into a New Dimension of Superhero Cinema,"""Madame Web"" stands as a bold, if not entirely successful, departure from the conventional superhero formula, bringing a gritty and grounded narrative to Sony's Spider-Man Universe. Directed by S. J. Clarkson, making her feature film directorial debut, this film dares to weave a more complex, character-driven story, focusing on Cassie Webb's (Dakota Johnson) journey from an awkward paramedic to a psychic powerhouse. Johnson delivers a nuanced performance, balancing wit and compassion as she navigates her newfound abilities and the heavy burden of saving the future.The film ambitiously tackles themes of destiny, sacrifice, and the search for meaning amidst chaos, setting it apart from its more action-centric counterparts. The inclusion of Sydney Sweeney, Celeste O'Connor, and Isabela Merced as the next generation of Spider-Women introduces a fresh dynamic, hinting at a richer, more diverse universe to come. Tahar Rahim's portrayal of Ezekiel Sims offers a complex villain driven by a mix of obsession and tragedy, a testament to the film's attempt at layered storytelling.While ""Madame Web"" may not have hit the mark for all, its effort to explore the psychological and emotional landscapes of its characters is commendable. The film's visual aesthetic, combined with a dedicated cast, hints at the potential for deeper, more introspective storytelling within the superhero genre. As a first step into uncharted territory, ""Madame Web"" suggests a promising direction for future installments, one that prioritizes character development and thematic richness over spectacle alone.In conclusion, ""Madame Web"" is a film that, despite its flaws, should be recognized for its ambition and the bold new path it carves for the Sony's Spider-Man Universe. It's a reminder that in the realm of superheroes, there's room for stories that dare to slow down and delve into the intricacies of what it means to wield great power, all while facing the very human struggles that come with it."
Jacqueline_MQ,10,"Generation of female heroines ""Madame""","I just finished watching Madame Web with a great feeling inside me, throughout the movie I have been saying to myself: ""This is Marvel, wow, it's fantastic, I like the character, nothing sexualized, not very tactful, a woman who loves her job and that he is not cared for by his aunt or by a rich man who ends up becoming his enemy or by a disgusting man who has always been watching him from innocence."" I have been able to remove all those clichés that always introduce female heroines and enjoy this film. Here are the points that I liked most about the script, the scenes and the internal argument that I have concluded.Cat: That kitten that enters the famous stairs of the Queen's apartments made me feel like Audrey Hepburn in the room. When Cassie calls him ""Cat"" I understood the kind of character she was seeing, independent, with her own secrets and dreams. Someone who would say: ""We are a pair of beings who do not belong to each other, a pair of nameless unfortunates, because I am like this cat, we do not belong to anyone. Nobody belongs to us, not even to each other."" I thought that wink was fantastic, because many women love that feeling of not having to be part of what is expected of a woman: that we name the cat.A woman without tact: I loved the Baby Shower scene, seeing that she was sincere, that they considered her strange, not to mention her childhood. If your mother was a mean person to you or she didn't love you enough, you don't have to hide the truth with a nice memory to look good.Another of the character's points against Ezekiel was that the bad guy this time is rich, with more powers and influence than the heroine. Cassie is not poor, she is an independent woman, but without the power of seduction, she could only defeat him with her mind. This point is crucial for the new generation, to present heroines and characters who are intelligent in mind, so much so that this ending was perfect, she saw more thanks to having let herself be carried away by intuition. If we consider women's intuition from a real perspective, it is that capacity that we have when we know that a deal, a client or a business is not going to have such a bright future, because we see what men are not capable of, the intentions,And finally, mention forgiving our mother, feeling hated before we were born, believing that we are the ones who made the race impossible, our mother's happiness made me cry in that scene where Cassie sees herself being born and even before.This film also talks about being a generation of parents who do not want children, but rather to be rich, to seek the American dream or in search of a new family more similar to the movies. Each girl represented what each of the women of our generation has had to live with her mother, creating a generation of ""Madame"" or ""Woman"" women, not ""Girls""."
tchaffee-10243,8,I actually liked it,"Listen, this movie is NOT an action-packed superhero film. It's setting up more movies to come.What it could have done better: it could have spent more time developing its villain and the young women. I know this is Madame Web's movie, but most of the characters felt flat.What it does well: there are plenty of Easter eggs that make this movie fun. At the end of the day, my wife and I enjoyed the movie. It was also does ""girl power"" the best by not having it forced down your throat; it's just a movie with some women doing their thing...which they set up to be much more in the future.I say, give it a chance. I think much of the hate is from social media. It's actually a fun popcorn movie."
gregcortez-16262,10,Awesome!,"This movie was wonderful, it was action packed and it had really sweet moments! The three young actresses that were cast were excellent ! Now a days supposed marvel/superhero fans want these type of movies to be at the level of endgame ! That cannot be ! Let these good movies shine and stop being party poopers! My one and only complain is that it was a bit slow in the beginning. Other than that I loved that it was women led and can't wait for the girls to become more! It was funny it was heartfelt and Dakota Johnson was AMAZING! Pls don't let what happened to the marvels happen to this one too! Loved it pls give it a chance !"
lizasealey,10,Amazing movie,"What a fun watch. You got Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott, Sydney Sweeney, Mike Epps AND Emma Roberts in one movie. Fun storyline, cute relationship with Cassie and the girls and a great addition to the Marvel universe. People gotta give Dakota Johnson more credit, she's so funny in this. I love her awkwardness and comedic timing. Isabella Merced is CRIMINALLY underrated. She was fantastic in Instant Family (with Rose Byrne and Marky Mark, another great movie). I love to see Sydney Sweeney in anything, she was amazing in Anyone but You, (a cool gay movie). She's really good in here as well, fun to see her as a nerdy girl. 10/10 loved this movie👍👍"
mailforsarah,8,Fun,"Has a strong start and exciting ending. Fun and empowering young adult and teen superhero movie. Has the typical lack of 2-way conversation and shyness around vulnerability a superhero movie has, but has a good empowering ending to make up for it. I'm glad the newer generations get to have this action movie.My only issue: what about that scene where the main characters walk away from their active bon fire in the middle of a forest. They didn't douse it out nor make a comment about it. Just in lala land, let's start a fire in the forest and then walk away from it. After all these massive wildfires, are you serious???"
nqmtxp,10,I don't get the negativity,"Not sure why all the low ratings on this movie. It's decent film! I enjoyed it very much and was not bored once...It's not as bad as people are making it out to be. The villain was a bit annoying but Dakota did a great job in her role. The story line was also decent.I read the reviews before watching f and was expecting some horrendous film and got the complete opposite. I wouldn't say it's the best film of all time, but it's definitely not the worst of all time. I wouldn't mind seeing the sequel !People nowadays criticize every little thing in movies, just sit back and enjoy and stop dissecting every second of it."
stephaniesegundocastillo,10,Don't understand the Hate,"Honestly I was unsure about seeing or spending money on the movie because of all the negativity from people saying it was horrible. But I decided to watch it and afterwards I just don't understand how people say it was bad or the worst movie because in all honesty it wasn't. Now Was it the best superhero movie, no but it definitely wasn't the worst. But Just like with Morbius people just like to hate for no reason and I don't think that movie was as bad as people say either. I do recommend watching with an open mind and not listen to all the negativity around the film. I'm personally not too familiar with the spiderverse so I'm coming from an unbiased and unfamiliarity perspective. It did make me excited to see what else is in store and I hope they continue with the spiderverse and seeing how the characters and more all Come together in the future."
zombiesqueens,10,An exciting fresh breath of air for superhero fans,"This was such an exciting movie, it had quick pacing so there are no boring lulls. Some of the moments gets somewhat confusing but in my opinion it adds to it to help you feel the confusion the character was feeling.It had a lot of quips that feel like the type of joke you remember in the shower after the conversation passed gripping over how perfect it'd be. A lot of the scenes focused on conversation felt a lot more realistic than a lot of movies do recently. There were little pauses of awkwardness you'd see in a real world conversation. This made the movie feel more attainable instead of everything having to be perfect all the time.The characters have their own flaws and show their own growth through the movie as well making me really cheer for them as a unit by the end of the film.Now for my salty rant on the bad reviews this movie has been getting:I'd understand if someone rated this movie as low as a 4 due to opposing tastes but the amount of hate this movie gets is very excessive. It seems to me most people are watching it only to search for things to hate. This movie is not a bad movie, the only thing it is guilty of is being different. It's not trying to live up to the bar marvel set and is trying to do it's own thing. If you watch it with an open mind without expecting the negatives I believe you'd enjoy it.Also. To everyone who keeps talking bad about Dakota Johnson being in 50 shades of grey: You're gross and need a life. Nothing about this movie is about or relating to Dakota Johnsons acting past and your opinions on it have no place in a review for an entirely different movie which was released a decade later."
fqjwpx,8,It was a hit for me.,"As I find the regular Marvel movies / TV shows extremely hard to follow now, I enjoyed the fact that this movie was fresh and an origin story. We are learning along side Cassandra, which I felt brought the audience in. There is enough bad stuff going on in the world these days, and it was nice to sit for 116 minutes and escape. Not only were there some star studded actors in the mix, but the special effects and comic book essentials were there. If there is one movie to see this season it definitely should be on your list. Plus the fact Sydney Sweeney plays a freaking teenager after just playing along side Glen Powell in ""Anything But You"" go off!"
dianazayn,10,"Really good, loved it!","I don't like reviews, lazy to write them but i had to write one because i know there is going to be many negative reviews from misogynistic degenerates because the lead is female even though its from comics :)Anyway i loved the cast, Dakota really did well! Loved her. The villain is good i liked the suit they created for him, i liked the fights scenes. I didn't read the comics so i dont know if its accurate to it, but i searched for comics version to see the character and the suit is same as the one in the very end of the movie and that is very cool!It's worth the watch <3And that's all thanks for reading xD."
lostmundane,10,Definitely worth it!!! 10/10,"Madame web is a movie that is definitely worth a watch. Maybe even more than once. It's a movie filled with twist and turns that would give you slight jumpscares seasoned with humour. Dakota's acting made the character more enjoyable. When she was performing funny scenes, it looked so effortless. All the characters were presented well and everyone definitely did their part right. I would give this movie 10/10 as watching it made my day better. A day well spent with a good movie. Go watch it too. It is different than usual spider movies but that is exactly what makes it special. The trailer didn't do justice to the movie as it is better than the feeling u get by the trailer."
movies-19278,9,I like this movie!,"This movie is so good! I think this movie will be boring, but I actually enjoy the movie and I really want to see the second part! Yeah I don't like many thing, but the movie still good! The villain is good, but forgetful!The cast is so good.Dakota Johnson have best performance, she acting the character actually very good. The 3 girls they is just Incredible! I really like and enjoy the movie 🍿🎥! Yeah we don't have post credit scene 😞, yeah they deleted Andrew Spider-Man, if they didn't deleted the scene with Andrew Garfield, the movie will be just a masterpiece! I give the movie 9, I don't care about critics review and other rating. This is my opinion!"
JAlexHorton,10,It's a good start,Loved the story telling.. it's the beginning.. you can't tell the whole story in one movie. People need to cut it out. I enjoyed it and hope to see the girls blossom into spider women in the next movie. Give it a chance. I think all of the female leads did an excellent job and I would love to see another.. maybe Disney could take over so the next installment satisfies other people.. but I think it was great. There is only so much you can do in 2 hours and I feel they did a good job providing some background and subsidence to the story that would evolve in future movies. Stop hating and give the movie a chance. Dakota did a great job.
deena-kistasami,10,It's a story that needed to be told,"Don't pay any heed to the negative reviews. It's worth watching. There's a beginning of a long story to be told here, if you're a fan of the actual comics then you will understand. The villain does a really bad job at acting, I'll give the negative reviewers that, but watch it if you're a Marvel fan.There are some things that could have been done better when it comes to CGI. Music was nat as bad as people made it out to be and there where times that it fitted the scene.This movie doesn't deserve the rating that it's got. I gave it a 10 star, but that was to bring up it's rating. It really sits around a 5.5, purely because the villain was such a bad actor."
tjlemon-84636,8,Why the bad reviews?,"Just watched Madam Web after reading so many bad reviews. Was looking forward to seeing it since seeing the trailers a while back, so thought I'd go watch it.Honestly, I can't understand why it's been reviewed so badly. I actually think it's a good movie and really enjoyed it. So glad I didn't take to much notice of the reviews.My advice, if you're thinking of going to see it, then do. Make up your own mind afterwards as to whether it's good or bad. I'm glad I did. Reading the bad reviews I wonder have people actually watched this movie or maybe they're not into these types of movie. I am, and I enjoyed it, and I hope they make a sequel."
vadnj0-392-683741,10,Worth the view!!,"This movie was a great movie. Dakota Johnson played a great part. The story was a refreshing take on a Spider-man character beside the famous web-slinger. Her powers start to emerge as a dangerous foe is lurking in the shadows
The story begins as her mother is seeking a rare spider in the rainforests known for its restorative properties. Tragedy strikes and we are taken to modern day life of Cassandra Webb. She soon learns after a dangerous day on the job that her life is far from ordinary. Before she knows it she is plunged into a life and death battle with an unknown foe and she must protect 3 strangers who seem to fall into her lap."
jason-mogollon,9,I actually enjoyed this...,"Okay so I am literally sitting in the theater now watching the credits and I just googled whether or not there was going to be an Easter egg at the end of this which is not. I happened to notice the first review and that person rated it one star and said that it was utterly disappointing and I don't know I enjoyed it. I mean no it wasn't like the typical Marvel movie, but it was still enjoyable to watch. I can't say this though there are certain things that I would have done differently if I had been the director because the way they did it just made it too far fetched, ya know? Like the part where the ambulance is driven off the top level of a parking garage and it crashes onto the ground and she still driving it?!?! There's a couple other instances where it just seems too far fetch to be even true but I know nothing is at it seems. Some people are going to like this movie and some people are going to hate it. When I'm deciding whether or not to see a movie, I never ever base it off of other people's reviews. I watch the trailer and I loved it."
tarek-54018,10,Such a beautiful and enjoyable movie,"The film is very interesting and entertaining, and this is exactly what all films should aim for.Personally I do not understand the reasons for the comments that aim to prevent people from going and enjoying this film.In my opinion, Sony presented a beautiful film, whether in terms of directing, acting, or production, and the most important thing that was the existing story .For sure I loved the perfect performance from Dakota Johnson , who gave a beautiful performance in the role of Madame WebI want to advice anyone who wants to watch the movie to not be affected by these negative comments or their attempts to give a low rating for the film , because what is clear is the same strategy they followed with the movie (Moribus)The ending of the movie was very good and I hope that there will be a second part of Madame web."
ArkhamQuinn,10,Perfectly Imperfect,"Johnson is awesome in this imperfect, perfectly entertaining comic book movie that leans heavily into being a suspense thriller reminiscent of Final Destination which Deserves none of the rampant hate and review bombing.Yes, some of the dialogue is cringey but it doesn't ruin the film as a whole.I'm addition I loved the paramedic scenes and thought it was a great way to flesh out Johnson's character, which was also refreshingly relatable and actually reminded me of Jessica Jones.As I mentioned earlier, the film really embraces the suspsense thriller aspect and in more than one action scene, did my anxiety go through the roof in the best way possible."
adeladnan-12611,10,Good movie,"A sweet, fun and entertaining movie. A nice story, but it needs attention. Dakota Johnson excelled in the lead role. All three girls were distinct characters, but Sydney Sweeney stole the show. The villain was conventional and selfish, and his only goal was to survive. The visual plots were well done and the direction was excellent But the scenario should have been better, because it contains many loopholes, incomprehensible things, and quick decisions. Some of the dialogues were plotted and some of them were clunky. In the end, it is an enjoyable movie, but you can watch it once or twice. It is a nice movie, but it could have been better. I am looking forward to the appearance of Madame Web and the three Spider-Women in the upcoming movies."
pearce-andy,8,Watch it yourself make your own mind up,"I saw it on the first screening of the day on the day it was generally released in the UK. Yet already it's been review-bombed by people who, quite often, said they knew it was going to be poor based on the cast, the trailers, the fact it was made by Sony.. Yet we're still some of the first people to rush to see it? I don't get it. It's very different to the mainstream superhero movies in tone and style. Action is more of the thriller, jump-scare type than the choreographed fight sequences we are used to. Dakota Johnson's character is surprisingly relatable in the way she handles the situation she is thrust into. The team the movie is setting up looks pretty cool too and hopefully that goes somewhere. Go on. Watch it yourself, if you hate it, fine. But don't review bomb something you likely haven't seen."
lucasvdpoel-33956,10,Best film ever,"My favorite movie everThe movie has good character development. Its starts of strong with an good introduction to the villian.Throughout the movie the scenes never gets boring. Every scene contributes to the movie and is utmost important.For the rest the movie is completely realsitic, the producers really researched into the medical truth. Like that CPR helps when you get poisonned. Also that teenagers can perform CPR after a 5 min practice is totally accurate.The ending makes completely sense and is totally understandable and ends the movie with respect.Lets go girl power, this movie is an complete comeback for marvelJk total garbage."
scientists-13613,10,Suspenseful and thrilling,"The plot to this movie is incredible. Every moment you're wondering what will happen next, or if the it predictable, you're wondering how they will film it and how the characters will react. All of the actors are perfect for their parts. The characters are approachable and funny, and they make a connection with the audience that makes you really worry about them throughout the movie. I think this film is getting bad reviews because it stars women and was directed by a woman. At worst, this film is a fun romp, at best, your new favorite standalone superhero movie! This is what the MCU should be looking to for its future!"
slaker-35665,10,Haters gon hate,"I don't know how people could give this movie, such a low rating and bash it so hard. Yeah, maybe it wasn't a 5 star movie, but it sure as bad as everyone made it out to be. Oh wow I didn't realize I needed to write a certain amount for a review. Okay, lol the only thing different about this movie than every other Marvel movie is that there are more women than men in the film. In my opinion, the storyline was unique but strong, and I would go as far as to say that I would watch it again. I hope they come out with a sequel! I didn't get to watch the end scene after the credits, but I will be sure to watch it when I rent it someday."
repercusiune,10,A good Saturday movie,"I didn't see the trailer before seeing the movie... I find that the trailer is giving way too much important and crucial parts from the story...
So please, please, DO NOT watch the TRAILER!The story is good enough for a good movie, with new effects and details that I was not expected. The actors did their best. Although, the end can be better...I don't understand why the movie is until now so low rated. Overall I would give it an 7+, maybe 8 stars. Giving 10 just to counteract the unrealistic rating.Hope they will stop with this first story thus. Normally the new movies that follow are worse and I don't want to destroy the fist impresionat and this nice story line. 🙂I recommend with love! Enjoy watching!"
johanjacobusvdwest,8,Something different than all the other Superhero movies in a good way!,"Most gave a bad review, but it was a nice change from the normal superhero movie and really enjoyed the movie. I don't know what others have against the movie, but there is a clear storyline whith a twist at the end and really hope there will be another follow up movie in the future. I loved the characters and the actors that played the roles made the movie something to watch. The end could have been a bit different, but still made sense and leaves the story open for future movies. There could have been more about the story and how everything fitted together before the movie played out to the end, but will watch it again."
browniesnack57,10,The most wholesome Marvel movie you'll ever see,"Dakota Johnson was phenomenally cast as Cassie Webb, without a doubt. Her story starts earlier than she thinks, because she never bothers to question why she is so determined to help people in her role as a paramedic. But her destiny awaits. The aptly named antagonist, Ezekiel Sims (biblical bonus) is after three girls because a vision, that almost certainly derived from the curse he placed on himself in the 70s when he killed the ancestral Webb, Dr Constance; told him they would kill him. Wrong spider lady... Sony redeems itself after the invention of the Spider-verse with the extended cut: complete with women, and feels. And that guy from Severance ^^ I did not expect to cry so hard from a movie based on a comic I didn't bother to read when I was 6, but here we are. I cannot stress how impressed I am with the creative balance between action and plot progression in this truly underrated masterpiece."
yeetmatthewlll,10,One Of The Best Sony-Marvel Movies,"This movie was so good and had a spectacular storyline. Not only that, this film have the best fitting cast ever, Emma Roberts, Dakota Johnson?? I won't understand the hate for this movie or tolerate it. If you're scared to watch it because of the reviews and you don't want to waste your money like I worried, I promise you, if you walk in with a good mindset and ignore what the critics say, you will love this movie as much as the rest of us. It was perfectly lengthed, suspenseful and had great writing, not every movie has to be Endgame level or NWH or any pivotal movie because that's what make them special, but this movie was the perfect combination of not undermining Endgame and enough to love just the same, 100% recommended!"
tabathapayne-01063,8,I liked it,"When I first started the movie out already heard it was bad, but I never listen to others when it comes to movies because some opinions suck. I watch the beginning and didn't have very much hope for it however that's just because of the voice over on the villain which sounds awful and made it seem like the movie was going to be very very bad I kept watching and some of the graphics didn't give me very much hope for the movie. However, if you keep watching it does become very, good. I enjoyed the storyline the connection to Spider-Man which I geeked out on because I knew where the connection it's a definite must watch if you are a marvel fan and a Spider-Man fan. I hope another movie comes out soon with Madame Webb in it."
mandoz,8,An enjoyable movie!,"I don't understand all the bad reviews? Sort of reminds me of all the bad reviews that came out when Star Wars was first introduced! This movie was intriguing and full of action and fun to watch, never did it lose my attention. I usually give a movie at least an hour before shutting it down. If your looking for the same superhero format, well it's not there. The acting was good! Started out good and had an even better ending! This is a two bags of popcorn movie that will keep you wanting more. I would definitely love to see some sequel's, especially involving the three young girls and their becoming superhero's!"
sanataj-71140,10,Feminine Action Based Movie,I loved this movie I wasn't expecting it to be that good. I didn't like few things like that bar scene otherwise I loved it.I loved the story behind the mythical spider. I loved that train scene I loved Mobius' side of story. Just few part that were not good. People always make a fuzz about little things. I also feel like marvel's giving too many women superhero stories back to back is putting a bad effect on studio. They should have come up with better release plan. People have stopped enjoying the limited feminine action.I wanted to rate it 8 or 7 but due to total bad score I rated a couple of extra stars ⭐ to make a difference. 😃
menesesivonne,8,Entertaining AF,"I know alot of people hated this film , but I actually really loved it!! It was full of surprises!! Given that she was so confused with her future visions and past experiences. The villain was smart, but gentle enough to be trusting and once you found his true Intention he was actually scary. Everyone says he was slow and didn't fight, but forget he was fighting against somene who was seeing the future. I loved the slow build and the hopelessness she felt when she didn't know how to control her powers. I think the three girls were so innocent and remorseful when they realized what they were facing. All the actors did a great job in facing their confusion and future outcome. They acted like real people would in those situations. The only thing I didn't love was the inaccurate medical protocls and medical scenarios. They should have checked with a medical professional before shooting the scenes and what would happen in a real life threatining scenes. Including BLS training. Otherwise this movie was exciting and actually gave a folklore Insight into how the spiderverse started. The only thing I was disappointed in was the fact that madame webb ended up blind. Otherwise loved the movie and all the actors work. So good 👍 👏"
tink-28108,10,I nearly lost it,"Aside from Dakota Johnson's calm demeanor (which her profession as a paramedic makes up for) this movie was pretty awesome. I love the connection it makes to our current spider man (the mom being Mary and uncle Ben) as well as one of the girls being a spider woman from across the spider verse. The unnamed baby boy? Definitely Peter Parker. I'm a huge marvel fan and geeking out over the connections. Sydney Sweeny's character did bother me at first, but I grew to like it. The ending had me at the edge of my seat. My husband enjoyed it as well. I also had to remind myself while watching that it's set in 2003. Which answers a lot of questions that we initially thought were plot holes. I honestly have been seeing a lot of review bombs for movies that are mainly led by female casting. Before the review bombs I would have given the movie an 8 out 10. But because are literally leaving poor reviews because they don't like the actors I gave a couple extra stars."
eieieize,10,Good movie,"These brutal attacks are not acceptable, these grades are definitely not given out of fairness.These cruel attacks are not acceptable, these scores are definitely not given in fairness, maybe the movies do not meet the expectations of the fans, but this kind of cruel criticism is not right either, at least for the few times a female superhero who is not among the minorities has been found. I am afraid of the end of this trend, probably in a few years, the Queen of England in a few centuries ago will be played by an Asian or an African, like in the movie Napoleon, this situation should be corrected and the roles should be distributed fairly and in accordance with reality, and of course, in such a way that everyone's rights are respected. The films are not harmed, in addition, this film does not deserve these grades, it is an acceptable film, and what do you expect from a film other than entertainment? Give philosophy, history and physics lessons? Billy Wilder said, I make movies just to make movies, this is cinema."
infisphere,10,depth & self-empowerment,"If you are a wanderer of the rabbit holes of life--an explorer of the psyche & the language of the universe, this is by far one of the best films out there.On tier with Inception, Interstellar, the matrix, cloud atlas, but in superhero format.I can see why this movie can be upsetting to some, as it is very different from most marvel films. And I think that's PRECISELY what makes it INCREDIBLE.An absolute thrill, thought provoking, mind-bending, powerful experience.Some are hating on the cheesy jokes or one-liners, but I've noticed that's all marvel movies, and it's becoming endearing for the genre."
sulopekim,10,The steps to Enlightenment are here!,"Step 1: Watch the movie.Step 2: Enjoy enlightenment!So, S. J. Clarkson, you have transcended filmmaking! Zeke Sims in this movie was the deepest character alive. He spelt out his motivations, his parents didn't believe in him. This made me instantly relate to his struggles, even though my parents have always believed in me. Cassandra Web's mom said early on ""She's trying to stop me from working, I won't let her,"" to the baby in her womb. This made me instantly fall in love with the movie, as she was a hard working single mom, and it was truly captivating, even though I am not a mom (I'm not a woman) I am single. It was then I realized the movie was what I was looking for. And as it progressed the enlightenment came, I realized that Ben Parker was in fact NOT the brother of Peter Parker's father, but the brother of his mother, and Peter's father took the mother's maiden name! The rest of the movie forced me to undergo a metamorphosis and realize everything is connected. This was a hopeful movie about overcoming adversity and untangling webs to become enlightened. And watching this movie forced me to do both, so now I dance on tabletops and can do CPR with my mind!"
danialvirk,10,I'm Fully Satisfied,Best Movie I Have Ever Seen In My Entire Life. I want it's sequel. It's the excellent movie. Must watch. I recommend it. It's the greatest movie of all time. All people are wrong who said that this movie is flip. It's the best movie I want. I watched a beautiful movie after three months. Plz don't underestimate it. Must watch it. Must watch it I am telling u that this is a masterpiece. This master piece needs to be continue. I'm very busy person but I watched this movie it engaged me like a excellent content. I'm still watching it again and again again and again and still have same interest. Must watch. It worths it.
ganeamanuelac,9,THE MOVIE IS WORTH WATCHING TRUST ME,"I really don't understand all the hate that this movie gets, people saying that it's worse than Morbius but you should watch it, trust me, it's a really great movie. I had zero expectations and it amazed me, really. Dakota is a great actress. The plot is great. I really liked the idea of surrounding the movie around women and the connection between them. Before going to see the movie I read some of the reviews here on IMDB and I was really thinking "" how bad could it be"" and trust me, it's not bad at all. Seeing both Dakota Johnson and Sidney Sweeny in a movie together really made my heart pop. Loved it, I would give it a solid 8,5/10."
jacksonlatiak-16219,10,Changed my life,"When you think about an amazing movie, you probably think of something like Citizen Kane or Shawshank Redemption, but what if I told there is a movie that exceeds past those? That's right, I am talking about the one and only Madame Web. If you actually read this far, why? I am joking obviously, Madame Web is absolutely horrible. From the acting to the writing, you want this movie to stop. You would be better off watching Morbius on repeat for an entire week than watching this garbage fire. The acting is just bad, the one young chick with the red hair has the worst line in the entire movie ""Who are you, what are you doing?!?"" When she said this me and my movie partner just looked at each other in disappointment. The writing is just horrible, the time jumps do not make sense at all, and the characters just turn into geniuses randomly like going back to the red haired chick who just knew that the villain knew Madame Web. The villain is super boring and also badly written, he didn't die by getting slammed by a car, he didn't die by fire, nope, he died by a Coca Cola sign falling on him. To end this off... WHY DID SHE LOOKS LIKE PROFESSOR X AT THE END!?! She was for some reason blind and also disabled at the end, guess that happened when she fell in the water, didn't happen when she fell in the water in the beginning. The worst scene isn't even from the actual movie itself, THEY REUSED THE SCENE FROM SPIDER-MAN 2!!! WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. And that's the end, would not recommend to family members, your grandparents, your cousins, or any pregnant woman. Stay safe. TLDR; I would rather stab my eye open than watch this movie."
Morefiend,10,This movie deserves a higher rating than 3.9,"I had no prior knowledge of who Madame Web was. Upon hearing the negative reviews I was going to pass on watching it. Glad I changed my mind. The movie does a good job telling the beginning of her origins. She doesn't have super strength or fly, but she can be in multiple places at once and see into the future. This movie was pretty good. It's not fair all that hate it's getting. A 3.9 is not an accurate rating at all it's a decent 7. I would watch it again and I would like to see a sequel. I've sworn off watching Marvel movies because I find them repetitive and boring. I noticed whenever I got up to do something, I made sure to pause the movie so I would not miss anything."
simmswill,10,"For the negative ""critics""","I thought the movie was absolutely great. For the ""critics"" rating this movie poorly, you need to go find something else to do if you're just going to be so negative. Go find something better to do if you're just out here rating everything poorly. It's all the negativity in the world that will ultimately be our demise. Instead of thinking poorly about things, see the potential that it could have in the future.I would enjoy being able to see what madame web turns into if there are more sequels in the future. The movie itself has a lot of potential to end up being something great if everyone would give it a chance."
jhimbdln,10,Perfect movie,"The movie was perfect! I want to give 100/10. I can say this movie was better than the Avengers infinity war. The casts was on fire, they nailed their roles. The fight scenes was so exciting. This movie don't need Spiderman. Iam definitely watch this movie again and again. I will expect for a sequel. I can't see any reason why you should not watch it. Perfect team of spider women!!! The movie was perfect! I want to give 100/10. I can say this movie was better than the Avengers infinity war. The casts was on fire, they nailed their roles. The fight scenes was so exciting. This movie don't need Spiderman. Iam definitely watch this movie again and again. I will expect for a sequel. I can't see any reason why you should not watch it. Perfect team of spider women!!!"
simon27203,8,Don't judge,"I was seeing everyone online saying the movie was the worst marvel movie ever most people giving 1 or 0. But I was bored so I gave it a try. And to be fair it wasn't bad, Ms. Web beating her mother killer with out actually fighting and just by looking in to the future. Is pretty cool. I think people were think it was an action movie and that why they were disappointed. If you haven't seen the movie think you should give it a chance. Don't going in there think it superhero action movie . But you will be surprised to see your favorite friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man relatively speaking. So give it a try ."
rcowlingva,8,A Real Review Not Influenced By Other People's Opinions,"Went to see Madame Web without having seen anything other than the short description.My wife & I liked it a lot.Spoke to some friends and they were surprised I saw it based on all of the horrible reviews. Came on here to imdb and I'm reading about how this movie is the worst ever made, etc.I don't get it.It's a very good movie. The runtime is nearly 2 hours but that flew by.It's got a great, meaningful story with fantastic character development. The acting is great. A bit of humor. A lot of discovery.It is not ""End Game"" and certainly not ""Far From Home."" If you're looking for a huge battle of super heroes this is not the movie for you.But if you want clever fight scenes with consequential choices and villians who are evil for a reason, you will enjoy this movie.I'm thinking that the bad reviews are because some are hoping to see more cleavage and more super power battles. They don't want to have to figure out why a character would do something.Bottom line - I for one am looking forward to rewatching this movie and future Madame Web sequels."
sacrificesmade,10,Most fun female lead heroine movie since Wonder Woman!,"Let me first start off by saying I never leave reviews and have been using IMDB for 20+ years!I am a big Marvel/DC fan!I see all the people who probably don't like to see a female lead superhero movie that are leaving bad reviews and well I am here to tell you that this movie is action packed, the chemistry between the lead heroine and the 3 girls is fantastic, I was honestly wishing for a longer movie it went by too quick
Won't spoil this for anyone but don't believe the reviews, those people obviously don't like female superheroes, look at all prior female lead superhero movies besides Wonder Woman and you will notice a trend by these same people!If you love female action lead superhero movies, Spiderman and Madame Web comics. Watch this!You won't regret it."
carteraadam,8,Overly Criticized,"The movie itself was entertaining, granted it had its small flaws when it came to dialogue and editing. But other than that I think it was definitely a movie I could watch again. It definitely has something to add to the spiderverse as a whole. I think people have gotten so spoiled with every superhero movie being a crossover or something extremely loud and in your face. This takes it back to simple storyline with no prerequisites. I will say if your looking for a superhero movie its not it. But I don't think it is successful with telling the story about a character in the marvel universe that not many people are familiar with. I can see where some people may be disappointed if you're a comic book thumper. However, superhero genre movies are judged anymore as if they are going for Oscars. If you want to be entertained this movie does the job, despite overly critical reviews, It's definitely not the worst superhero movie I've seen.......... that would be Steel with Shaq."
vegeman69,8,Another just fine Sony Marvel film!,"Preface: I often wonder if the people who hate movies like this are mostly misogynistic men who can't handle women in positions of power! I have enjoyed the Marvel films that Sony has put out, even while acknowledging that in their totality, they are not on par with most of the MCU films. That being said, this film had a story, action, good acting, music, and special effects. If all I had in a video collection were the first 5 spider man films, both Venom ones, Morbius, Madame Web, and the upcoming Kraven film, I am sure that I would have many months of entertainment and would rewatch most if not all of them. Collectively they are better than the Eternals, many parts of Iron Man 2 and 3, and a few other MCU films. I am happy to be the voice of reason here, in a sea of bro's who find ways to rationalize hating films starring women! See it for yourself and make your own decisions!"
miltonalcorn,8,Great Movie!!!!,"It's fun, it's different and good. This movie is not you average Marvel Comic that's way it's good. The actors in this movie are new comers and they are really give the movie a different feeling. The premise of the movie is truly different from a regular Marvel movie that's what makes do good and interesting. So give it a try because you will like it the other people who viewed this movie might have had a bad day yo give it a bad review. My wife and I found it truly fun and interesting. I recommend this movie for a weekend watch do you can really enjoy it not during the week. Give it a try you will enjoy."
semeniukp,10,WOW!!!,"I loved every second of it, and i'm not kidding. I go to the cinema to relax, de-stress and forget about the world. And so it was in this case. In fact, it is without panache and at times bored me, but to call it the worst film ever made? Please, who saw ""Elektra"" from 2005 and ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", knows what I mean ;))) it wasn't the best, but it also wasn't the worst:) The best part of the film was probably Dakota Johnson. In addition to the comedic aspect, her amazing acting added some drama to the film. And the ending itself, quite intriguing, quite as if these characters would return in the future...."
tony-pinal23,10,Sweeney made the movie...,"Sweeney made the movie... they should of made her the main character.Over all, the movie was entertaining. Love the part when Sweeney entered the scene in true ""spidey"" form upside down. This move made it true to original comics.This is great that Sony pictures is expanding its Spiderman cinematic universe to include the Madam Web characters.To me, this movie was 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥
Here's a thought. How about adding Henry Cavill to this ""Spidey"" universe? 🤔
The story portrayed makes you appreciate that you don't need to watch prequel movies to understand to this storyline. Or learn their origin store from a different film."
scottwoodson13,8,Give it a chance.,"Best movie ever, no. Worst movie ever, not even close. Whomever was behind the film was playing the long game. Ben Parker, Mary Parker giving birth to Peter, it is all connected. Well, it would be if people would sit back and watch it for what it is, an entertaining movie.I hope that Sony will stay the course with this franchise as there is a lot of promise. The characters could use a little more development in the back story and this could be completed with any follow up movies.Think about this: without Madame Web, Andrew Garfield's version of SpiderMan would not be introduced into the Spider-verse."
lmbrack,8,Bad review because ppl/men who didn't know what to expect,"I didn't see anything wrong with the movie, and I really enjoyed it. I think most of the bad reviews are from people who were expecting an Avengers type of movie. This wasn't that, and that should be okay.This was a female driven movie with good actors and a decent story. Yeah, some things could have been better, but it was still a good movie. As an adult woman, I really enjoyed it.I hate seeing the bad review because I feel it's likely we won't get another movie, but I really would appreciate a sequel. Female friendly movies need better support. I imagine there are a lot of young girls out there who liked this very much, but unfortunately due to not being the target audience, that doesn't matter. I think a lot of guys went to this movie and just trashed it because it wasn't aimed getting them aroused like the majority of movies out there. Maybe a lot of bad reviews are also from people who don't like to see diversity in addition to female leads in movies, especially action movies. IDK I just don't get the bad reviews otherwise.This isn't like the other Marvel movies, and that should be a good thing. They're getting boring. This was a refreshing change.The story itself could have been a little fuller with more detail on the supernatural, but it progressed well enough and didn't drag. Actors were decent. Better than a lot of other movies out there. There was a good amount of action and suspense. There could have been more back story for the character development, especially on the villain, but there was enough and it kept the movie going and not getting too dragged down."
emilysoliz,10,Amazing nail biting MOVIE,It was so good I liked when she went vroom vroom at the end with her sassy sunglasses my boyfriend also loved every minute of the movie best date night. All the actresses really did their best I also liked the really coool spider. Really well done story very emotional cried a couple times when her mom died I was like whaaaaat who knew that guy was a bad guy unexpected twist I almost threw my popcorn on the floor from how shocked I was my boyfriend was shocked too we both almost freaked OUT and Mann did I cry so hard when her friend died in the car crash I was so emotionally invested in that guy.
qilc2010,10,BEST movie in over 20 years,"(Read till the end it will make sense)I walked into the theatre to see whatever was playing, any movie. A young (around 13) blonde white girl and young black girl were purchasing tickets and their debit card got declined. I saw one look at her friend in embarassment. I sensed a high level of empathy and conscientiousness in the way I saw them hold doors for everyone and kindly smile before I went into the building.I said hold on do it again and repurchase the tickets (to imply the machine was broken I skewed perception cause I knew they wouldn't accept handouts), and then when the tap option came I quickly tapped my card to pay for it, and then their faces looked guilty, so I walked away real fast to spare them shame/preserve dignity. They were shy and shrinking and overly accommodating.I wanted to see argyle, but the movie was a half hour in and Madame web was rated 2/10 at the time, so I didn't want to see it but there was nothing left so I did. I went in, and there was a theatre filled with young girls with their besties, and the atmosphere felt .. like something I didn't understand was calling them to it. The movie played, a bunch of girls skeptical but then looking up to a grounded logical female paramedic that didn't have grandiose desires but was called to help these girls. A beautiful nurturing bonding occurred in the friendship between the girls and Dakota who plays Madame web. I heard a beautiful like, ""when you step into your responsibility power follows."" I noticed the energy and girls around me laughing smiling empowered. I saw the way trust and community was restored in the movie.I saw the way everyone walked out healed and their face warm hearted, confident, smiling, more in their authenticity .. this is a very important movie.Dakotas acting was phenomenal as always, beautiful dialogue well thought out logic and powers, great synergy and important message.Send all your kids to it, and let the older men and women know that love and trust is gonna be okay.. this generation needs this.."
i-49634,9,Love it,"I really like movies where girl helps girl. The heroine of this movie has courage, responsibility and wisdom, but at the same time gives me a feeling of ordinary women, perhaps because this point makes me feel that this movie is charming. Ordinary women are afraid but become resolute in order to protect other women from the bad guys. They want to walk away but can't resist the kindness and sense of justice in their hearts, rather than the sexy and intelligent women portrayed in many action movies, who always feel deviated from reality or are women in the male perspective. What's interesting is that it's like the roles are reversed and the male villain in this movie is very typical and kind of boring just like women in other action movies.Another thing I like is the ending, the heroine and the three girls are ready to save the world together, both as friends and family members to protect each other even though their families brought them harm.After watching the movie I had a feeling this one would be made by a female director! And it was! Friendship and mutual help between girls should really be shown from a female point of view!"
artemhoncharov,10,These are true heroes - people who save lives,"Beautiful actress Dakota Johnson. Good example of courage and intellect. At long last a movie about people who risk their lives to save others.The plot may seem trvial and not very engaging, however, one should pay attention to the core features of characters' behaviour.1. Team work of Mrs. Cassandra and her partner Ben Parker - they save lives of others and back each other as well. This is what true partnership and team work is about.2. Readiness of Cassie to act without fully understanding the situation in which she finds herself. Decision making under pressure, or courage in other words, is valueless feature of humans.3. Cassie didn't know that her mother risked her life to find treatment for her using spiders biological material. She found out it only many years after the death of her mother. It means that we can assume but not state without fully knowing the situation."
stone1312,9,Surprisingly great,I went into this not expecting much but it was great. The storyline was good. Flowed well. There was a few meh bits but really good overall. I love spideyverse content this is definitely up there in top 5 for spiderverse films. The biggest down downside is the filming of it maybe I'm overly sensitive to fast moving scenes but they seemed out of focus a lot. I loved parts that joined it into the rest of the spiderverse. It was mainly the end scene that I found was really really cheesy. I think Sony does struggle with making a convincing bad guy. His storyline is blah and bland. But I seriously hope they do continue on from this with something. Strong female roles without pushing it in your face.
themusicfollows,9,Unprepared Women Fight Back,"I'm not sure where all the animosity comes from towards the film, and I don't really care to know. I honestly enjoyed it, yes, some of the scenes were awkward and Cassie was a difficult woman to root for in the first half of the film, but she had valid reasons to be.Those three girls were lost, confused, and wholly unprepared, like having never shot a gun, and being told, here, shoot the bullseye first try.Yes, this film wasn't perfect, but I left that theater fully believing that strength doesn't just come from muscle. It's heart, and these girls absolutely had it in the end. Together. XxX."
lancethompson-58046,10,This was an awesome movie,Madame web is one of the new best movies of 2024 and it's one of the best new movie in the spider-Man film series and madame web should have been 8.9 movie rating and it's one of the best movies ever. And Dakota Johnson should win best actor at all the awards and madame web should win all of the best movie cast at all the movie awards and every award out there and that should make Madame web 2 the movie with the same cast and s.j. Clarkson should 100% come back and directed Madame web 2 and it was an awesome movie with the bast cast and it's great movie and I like it an all and was good movie.
kristahinman,10,Really fun movie! Please make a sequel!,"Reading some of the reviews I'd put money that 99% of the negative reviews are men who just can't handle women ruling a super hero movie. Boring!As for the movie, I really loved it. I've watched it 3 times now. The characters are great and the story is fun to watch. It's nice to watch something now a days without tons of gore. I'm truly hoping there will be a sequel. They definitely left it wide open for more to come. I'll refrain from doing some long winded review like this is the Emmy's and being pretentious is necessary. There are plenty of those reviews to read. All in all I recommend it."
chandyneh,10,Wonderful movie,This movie was awesome! You all misunderstood the plot of this movie those of you who rated this movie poorly. The plot of this movie was to show how madame web came to be. Not all of us have heard about all the marvel comic book characters including myself who had never heard of Captain Marvel or Madame Web. This movie well explained who she is and how she came to be. This movie was an intro for other movies to come. I hope to see more. And for you men who rated this movie poorly quit being misogynistic! This movie shows us how the three girls came into madame web's life and how they will be in the future. It also shows you don't have to have a physical superpower to be a hero. You can be a hero by just saving lives by CPR.
saloy,8,Enjoyed it!,"Have no idea why folks are so down on this entertaining film. If you love the older Spidey films, just watch them again. This one? It's a very-fresh take on the Marvel classic.The older Spidey movies are great action, even romance, and fun to experience, and there are food female roles too just more traditional. Not this one. Talk about a different take on the entire experience of this Marvel Classic. SpiderMan move over for a new generation of sheroes!Love strong female leads. SHE leads with her mind! Brilliant. + the disrespecting youth learn to appreciate Cassie, & each other: Sweet! Thank you."
speizer-59517,9,Worthy of being in the Marvel Universe,"I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching Madame Web. Contrary to the many less than favorable reviews, I found the storyline interesting, plenty of action, and the characters engaging. In addition, there would seem to be plenty of opportunities to see these four heroines grow in future installments in what could be a promising franchise for the Marvel Universe. Dakota Johnson brings her character to life in her origin story and there are clear opportunities to see Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced and Celeste O'Connor grow into their characters as their origin story develops. It is unfortunate, however, that the reception of Madame Web hasn't been more favorable, which may limit the chance of future installments in this potentially promising franchise. However, with the potential for a crossover with the very successful Spiderman franchise, there might be storylines for a sequel that could be spun; I'll keep my eyes on the web to see if this sticks."
rokinpynk,10,I loved it!,"All this hate I don't get it. I loved it so much. I've watched it twice. I'd rather watch Madame Webb than any avenger movie ever... I love an all female kicking ass cast. I thought it was very good and everyone I've shown it to. They really liked it too. Only Like Aquaman that's cause he's really sexy In that movie. Again, I'm not hating on anybody not like in the movie. Everybody has their own opinion and you guys think more about acting and plots and all that stuff and I don't, but I was really sad to hear that. There's a good possibility. There won't be a second movie I was hoping to see how the girls got their powers and how they all worked together."
iangordonmiller,9,Despite the appalling negative reviews. This is a very enjoyable film that succeeds in what it set out to do.,"As someone with a diverse cinema taste including the many superhero films, I read with intrigue just how much the critics hated this movie. I was expecting it to be awful at every level. It wasnt!. In fact, I thought it was a very enjoyable contained fantasy tale that was effectively delivered. The acting was absolutely fine. The script was cogent. It never set out to challenge Shakespeare. The cinematography was visually entertaining. Again, it never imagined itself to challenge Avatar. The character development and plot were both sufficient and relevant, clearly inclining your perspective. The film has a target audience and I appreciate it won't appeal to everyone but I cannot help but believe the latter were not being entirely objective in reviewing it for what it was intended to do. I just don't understand why so many people dislike it! Try it for yourself and don't believe all of the reviews have been objective."
HeyimShibby,10,TIW Madame web,"Today I watched Madame Web and it was incredibly funny garbage fire.This movie is genuinely horrendous. There is not one aspect of this that is even mediocre, it is bad through and through. So bad it's good.Every person working on this film feels like they're only here for the paycheck. Pure contractual obligation. Check the interview footage, it's hilarious how much people just don't care about this movie, well besides the director.Like the director actually is just very bad at their job, but they pretend like they are really good... The movie and director come off as like... oddly pretentious, especially with the ending and the directors interviews.The camera movement is horrendous and visually unintelligible.The writing is very very very very childish, trivial, and stupid. The acting alongside the writing makes it seem almost like a parody satire, it's so funny. There is also bad audio dubbing, sound effects, transitions, bad musical layering, mixing, and overpresent original basic music that is incredibly insistent of an epic tone.This movie is basically disectable because it's so bad on every single account. You can look into every scene and get so much out of it because it's so... full of garbage. Every. Single. Scene.Overall, if you like so bad it's good movies, this might be a classic for you. Otherwise this is a genuinely terrible film with very little even slightly okay about it.Mid 1/10PS. A very hilarious 1/10.Edit, watched this again. Changing it to a 10 because it is absolutely hilarious the entire movie. So yeah, for me it's a10/10. It's hilarious."
steiphanking,10,Am disgusted in every rating this movie lowly,"The only wrong thing about Madame Webb is the taxi.It was so unrealistic for them to steal a taxi and have it for a whole movie without being caught car was a wreck broken wind shield but that's a minor detail I rate it a 10/10 we've seen various characters evolve in the most unrealistic way but in this one we see character development
I would be angered if the writers immediately gave those kids powers like in that very instance because Ezekiel was a skilled fighter he had done this all his life most of his training is dedicated to manage defeat his vision
But he couldn't because we see character development."
antonelajnv,10,Not as bad at all,"The movie deserves a bit of credit. It has enough hate. So my review is ten out of ten.( On purpose 😉)Let's just not give negative reviews constantly for everything. If there is madame webb two I will watch it as well.Also I have to write these review longer so it can be posted even though I don't want to write more, so, i'm wishing you a good day to all of you that are reading this review now. :))))
Let's be happy, chill and supportive.I know this is a particular place where you have to rate movies and not give a damn but giving little bit of credit didn't kill nobody.Oh my god, is this review finishing everrrrr.....okay Finally! 😂
Bye!"
Speedysue2003,10,Do Not believe the bad reviews!,This was a very entertaining movie! I enjoyed it very much. The bad reviews are from people who did not watch the movie very well. You must pay attention to all the story. Don't play games while watching it. Don't have your friends over unless you are all listening to the dialog. The movie gave you good back stories but the haters were not listening and thinking for themselves. If you know the series you would understand the movie! The acting was great. Dakota Johnson was very good. Action scenes were awesome. Cinematically well done. Just an awesome movie. Thank you Marvel. PLEASE GIVE US A SEQUEL. With the same actors.
andonovaradoslava,10,Great movie!,"Great movie! Entertaining, charming and funny at the same time full of action. Not 1 min.of the movie was boring or slow so I enjoyed it to the max. As a great fan of Marvel and the Spider-verse, I want to say that Dakota is the perfect Madame Web, such an amazing cast that I can no longer imagine someone else playing the Madame Web character. What I would have wanted to see is a bit more of the birth of Peter- would have been amazing not just to ""mention/show"" it in a way, but maybe if it included a close moment between the baby and Uncle Ben and actually mentioning that the parents chose the name Peter, would have made the whole ""moment"" much more intriguing and ""dramatic"". But overall a very pleasant movie I would love to see a crossover in future between Madame Web and Spider-man."
ashuragod,8,Different From Most superhero movies,"I believe the movie was a good introduction to The Madame Web universe, from the vilain ( who had so much potential) to her past, and saving the girls and how much everything was connected. It's extremely different from what we usually get for Superheroes origin stories, since we only got a glimpse at what they are going to become. I gave a solid 7 for the story telling and actions, how cool it was to see them connecting and relating with one another, and Cassie becoming their adoptive mother in a way. I wish the end will show a bit of how they got their powers but I guess that would be for Sequel."
rjqnpywh,8,Solid and entertaining,"I went along expecting the worst but was charmed and engaged by the film. What is presented is not a typical superhero nor a typical superhero movie. It's not that it's therefore superior, more cerebral, mind blowing: it just takes a different path, and doesn't feature a totally cliched protagonist. The action sequences and the set pieces are well done with a few bits that had me laughing out loud in their absurdity but still going ""ok, that was good"". I know there's blood on the water now for the film and one review isn't going to change hearts and minds but honestly, people must not see many films if this is attracting 1 star reviews."
abalpn-99472,10,Wow! This film is ok and entertaining. 👍,This film had most of the action scenes. That's what I noticed. The graphics and special effects were interesting of course. All the lighting and zooming. They were mind bending indeed. All the scenes make you feel that something is about to happen like there were some intense moments coming out to surprise the audience. There were some funny moments that I enjoyed. Dakota Johnson gave a great performance as Madame Web. Even the other cast were ok as well.I've watched some episodes of Spider-Man: The Animated Series and it made me think of the character in that show. I know that there are many variations of her in the comic books. I've researched who she is and what her powers are. Knowing that she's a clairvoyant seeing visions of the future.The director should've extended a bit longer because this movie was approximately an hour and something minutes. It's not as big as all the Marvel films that we've watched over the years but I'm not saying that this one is purely bad. The special effects were cool and interesting so that makes it count. This film is still ok and good for entertainment. I still give this film a thumbs up.

siriustrees,10,"""Veiling the Mind's Eye: Madame Web's Odyssey into the Unseen""","Embarking on Stardew Valley, I anticipated a straightforward journey of pastoral simplicity. Yet, beneath its unassuming surface, a narrative as convoluted and enigmatic as the darkest cinematic mysteries began to unfold. In Pelican Town, every planted seed and nurtured relationship spiraled into a narrative labyrinth, challenging my perceptions of reality, much like the complex webs of deception and illusion one might expect from Madame Web. However, where Madame Web tangled itself in its own ambitious plot, Stardew Valley masterfully wove a tale of profound depth and intrigue.The daily rituals of this virtual Eden masked a deeper exploration of existence, where the ordinary transformed into the extraordinary. The townspeople, with their myriad secrets and desires, mirrored the complex characters of a psychological thriller, drawing me deeper into a story where truth flickered like a shadow, elusive and ever-changing. This journey through Stardew Valley, with its shifting realities and hidden depths, paralleled the twisted narratives found in tales of intrigue and mystery, where nothing is as it seems, and every revelation leads only to more questions.Stardew Valley's serene façade belied a complex exploration of the human psyche, turning each in-game day into a step deeper into both the valley's and my own subconscious. Here, the boundaries between game and reality blurred, each discovery a piece of a puzzle that, when pieced together, revealed a picture far different from what I had initially perceived. This game became a reflection of the intricate dance between perception and reality, where Madame Web's attempt at a multifaceted narrative paled in comparison to the genuine depth and complexity Stardew Valley offered.As I delved deeper into the heart of Pelican Town, I found a community of players whose shared experiences echoed the collective journey through our own psychological mazes. This communal narrative, rich with individual stories of discovery and revelation, underscored the profound impact of Stardew Valley. It became clear that this was not just a game, but a journey into the unknown, challenging us to question our understanding of reality, much like the protagonists of the most bewildering psychological thrillers.In this digital idyll, Stardew Valley emerged not merely as a game but as an enigmatic masterpiece, ensnaring players in a narrative web as intricate and unpredictable as the plot twists of Madame Web, yet with the depth and coherence the film aspired to but ultimately failed to achieve. In the end, Stardew Valley revealed itself to be a mirror, reflecting the complexities of the mind and the elusive nature of truth, far outshining the tangled narrative of Madame Web with its serene yet profoundly deceptive storytelling."
kresenda,8,I was shocked that I enjoyed it,"Was it on par with Spider-Man? No. Was it enjoyable? Actually yes. Was it what I expected based on the trailer? God no. This was waaaaay less a superhero movie than I expected. It wasn't presented to us as an origin story, but that's what it is. You get far more origin than superhero. In an era where all of our superhero movies are go go go action, it was kind of nice. Was/is Dakota Johnson a little flat? I mean, it's her. You've seen her movies, I'm sure. That's like asking was Sydney Sweeny big boobed. But overall? It was kind of sweet, what was pleasant. It was nice to see ""teenagers"" (or women playing teenagers) a acting impulsive, like teenagers. If you enjoy good-bad movies from the 90s that had less action and more heart, you might enjoy this. If you're a dude looking for a bad af movie, maybe skip it and try Dolph Lungren's Punisher."
nrmpndf,8,I liked it. For a superhero origin movie it's good. Some of the reviews I've read are a bit unjustified,"Yes another superhero movie. Definitely sense that the general public and critics in particular have had enough of superhero movies. This movie is pretty good. I liked it better than MorbiusIt's a time movie so there's a bit of going back in forth in time which could be confusing for some but I thought it was entertaining and the time jumps were done well in my view.If anything it ended too quick. The actor that played the villain lacked substance and his backstory wasn't told well. I couldn't really workout why he was doing what he was doing.The rest of the cast was good. I think they were trying to make a connection to Spider-Man but could have tried harder. Felt like a commercial reason they didn't make a connection which was annoying. Even if they told us which universe it was part of and after credit scene, it would hand made the movie better."
danielp-52283,8,"Kind of confusing, but still a banger","There was sincerely a lot in this movie that had me left confused. I saw it with my friend who always watches marvel movies with me and we have never been more confused from a marvel movie. First off, we never even got to learn the bad guys name. His name was said one time and I couldn't even tell you it now. Second, I found it very confusing how the main characters knew who the bad guy was just by looking at one picture of him without his suit on. They just saw the guy and were like ""oh that's him."" I personally loved the way they showed off madame webs powers and the potential she has. I also thought it was neat how we got to see Ben Parker at the time he found out he was going to be an uncle. It all brings the spider verse lore together when we get to see the beginning of it all with the spider people. It was definitely an entertaining film and the CGI was breathtaking in most scenes, and still good everywhere else."
xjdfxfmxjk,10,Comical Genius Best of 2024.,"Madam Web is one of those movies that only comes across once every blue moon. Although a little difficult to keep my pecker in my pants and get removed from the theater of all six times watching it, it was truly an out of body experience. Similar to that of the usher half time show. That is to say 10/10 rock solid the whole watch. I LOVE PEPSI✊🏿! The performance from the black woman gave me chills. I was shocked everyone they came on screen. I came on the screen. The writing at some points was simply priceless. The visual effects had tossing and turning in my chair every watch. I could barely contain myself, I simply wanted to be in the movie similar to the spider pool in the movie. 10/10 again meaning 20/10."
yorkscotta,10,Fantastic!!!,I loved it! I'm a big fan of madam web! This movie is better than all the marvel movies put together. I believe that everyone will come around and will star dancing while replaying the movie over and over and over again. I think that Stan Lee should of stopped with madam web and not even invented Spider-Man he is too cheesy then they have to just have a hard time to finding cheesy people to play a cheesy character. Sometimes I just don't think that this movie should win all the awards even awards for best chase seens best out in the woods seen and definitely best 3 girls dancing on top of the table seem. Thanks for making this awesome movie enjoy everyone!!!
guarddarkshadow,9,I thought it wasn't that bad.,"I thought it wasn't that bad of a movie. Had some action, had some Thriller, had some mystery and some imagination. Let me tell you I think this is not bad compared to other superheroes movies or series that I have seen before. The only thing that I see bad about it was the movie ended. In my opinion we didn't really get to see how the other girls become they're super character. I like to get more movies of these characters. And see where they go from here. I think this is very interesting in my opinion. Please bring some more like this. Another thing it would be neat if they would bring Spider-Man and the other spider characters among this."
breadandhammers,,Lifeless acting,"Directed by: S. J. Clarkson
Written by: Matt Sazama, Burk Sharpless, Claire Parker, S. J. ClarksonSUMMARYA young woman begins to receive visions of someone trying to hunt down and kill three girls. She warns and protects the girls. In the end, she protects the girls with the visions, is blinded, and becomes their mother figure.RATINGCDespite everyone's damnation of this film - and it is indeed not a great film - I actually think there were some great moments here. Under the trappings of a superhero film is a cool thriller about a woman who receives visions and tries to prevent them, and this could have been a cool thriller like Source Code. However, the central pillar - besides clunky writing - that makes the film completely collapse is Dakota Johnson's lifeless acting. None of the actors care, and it shows."
savvypatachonica,,"Looked like it might be bad, was even worse than imagined.","I don't know what I was thinking getting a ticket for this stinker in advance... the trailer was full of cringe, but I suppose I was just bored and wanted something fun to go see on a date night. I'm also pretty well versed in this universe, but all I can say (before I continue saying more because there's a character limit on IMDB) is ICK. There is nothing exciting or remotely endearing about this mess. Just another super hero movie because that's been a cash cow in other situations but this particular film is just a soulless placeholder trying to get people in seats. Congrats, you got my money. I hope nobody else is as dumb as I was. Complete waste of time."
jackmerrigan,7,It's a jumping off point,"Honestly not sure if it's low expectations on my end or high expectation on the audience end, but I found madam web a solid film.Obviously this is a set up, as madam web is an iconic character from the 90's tv show. Furthermore, the character named Ben is clearly uncle Ben, while Emily Robert character is Peter Parker's mother. Besides the foundation that it sets, I found the film very entertaining. It echoed aspects of the spider verse through the last few decades.I found the acting some what poor at times, but obviously there is a lack of attachment on my end on these characters, for the 3 girls are new territory for me info wise. Furthermore, there may be an dissociative aspect on the actors part to embody the full form of their character, due to information that might be hidden due to fear of exposure of future plots. Thus, the actors are unable to fully embody their characters, for they are unsure of the past, present and ironically the future of the character in question. This is of course conjecture, for I feel since plot leaks in the past have lend to ""less"" money being earned at the box office."
agrawalyash-88541,,Morbius seems 10x better now,The actors are clueless who have no idea about acting or their role infact they don't even know they are working for just Sony and not Marvel. Let them stick to r rated films and not destroy our childhood characters. Script is another disaster from the writers of morbius and for that matter yes morbius was still better. Mid cinematography but good point is that managed to create 2000s era that's only good thing but nothing out of the box. Watching at your own risk it's not even good for timepass. Once again I would say Sony needs to stop it's not even funny anymore they better merge out or do something.
bfan-74709,,Madame Flop,"I Haven't Seen This Movie I Had Just Seen Clips And Reviews About This Movie Now Here's Why I Don't Like Madame Web:
1. CGI: Yes Budget For CGI Is a Lot Of Money But At least Terminator 2 Has better CGI
2. Story: The Story Didn't Feel Like a Spider-Man Story It Felt Like Fan Fiction That Came Out Of Marvels Backside Like Uncle Ben Get The Hell Out
3. Police Assault: The Main Characters Taking Down The Main Bad Guy Who Is a Walmart Spider-Man Decided To Kill Cops
4. Enjoyment: There Was No Enjoyment From This Movie At least Batman And Robin Was Enjoyable And The Story Made Sense And So Did Morbius."
